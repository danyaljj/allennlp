How much time passed between the 1st radio mayday transmission and the second?
The hijackers attacked at 9:28.  While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet.  Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft.  During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring "Mayday" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit.  The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing.  The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here."  On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers.  This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001.  But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation.  The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams.  They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff.  On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers.  The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August.  Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight.  FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel.  We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight.  All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them.  We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight.  All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them.  We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

Which two factors were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93?
The hijackers attacked at 9:28.  While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet.  Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft.  During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring "Mayday" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit.  The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing.  The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here."  On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers.  This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001.  But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation.  The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams.  They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff.  On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers.  The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August.

Bin Laden delivered diatribes in what two locations?
Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia.  He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan.  In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western "occupation" of Islamic lands.  Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996.  In ensuing weeks, Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off "the head of the snake."  By this time, Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.  Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons.  Some of Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates.  For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan.  The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Laden admired, was also in the network.  Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.  There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.  In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label "al Qaeda operations" too often in these early years.  Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections.  And in this network, Bin Laden's agenda stood out.  While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya, Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the "far enemy"-the United States.  After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction.  In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans.

Military Notification and Response.  Boston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command.  In addition to notifications within the FAA, Boston Center took the initiative, at 8:34, to contact the military through the FAA's Cape Cod facility.  The center also tried to contact a former alert site in Atlantic City, unaware it had been phased out.  At 8:37:52, Boston Center reached NEADS.  This was the first notification received by the military-at any level-that American 11 had been hijacked: FAA: Hi.  Boston Center TMU [Traffic Management Unit], we have a problem here.  We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York, and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there, help us out.  NEADS: Is this real-world or exercise?  FAA: No, this is not an exercise, not a test.  NEADS ordered to battle stations the two F-15 alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Massachusetts, 153 miles away from New York City.  The air defense of America began with this call.  At NEADS, the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to Battle Commander Colonel Robert Marr.  After ordering the Otis fighters to battle stations, Colonel Marr phoned Major General Larry Arnold, commanding general of the First Air Force and NORAD's Continental Region.  Marr sought authorization to scramble the Otis fighters.  General Arnold later recalled instructing Marr to "go ahead and scramble them, and we'll get authorities later."  General Arnold then called NORAD headquarters to report.  F-15 fighters were scrambled at 8:46 from Otis Air Force Base.

Who had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars?
The White Rajahs of Borneo: In the 19th century, Borneo remained relatively undeveloped.  Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei.  Sarawakâ€™s coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Ibanâ€‚â€”â€‚Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers.  (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities.  ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony.  Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore.  In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803â€“1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei.  He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit.  In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier).  He tried to halt the Dayaksâ€™ piracy and head-hunting while defending their more â€œmorally acceptableâ€ customs.  His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted.  His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border.  Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula.  In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles.  More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life.  He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace.  Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was â€œrentedâ€ from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent.  Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Companyâ€‚â€”â€‚a charter similar to that of the EIC.

Who tried to limit the Chinese opium trade?
The White Rajahs of Borneo: In the 19th century, Borneo remained relatively undeveloped.  Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei.  Sarawakâ€™s coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Ibanâ€‚â€”â€‚Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers.  (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities.  ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony.

What happened to Jerusalem after the Christians lost it?
Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks: The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head.  They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin.  During the Sixth Crusade (1228â€“ 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation.  The Christians, however, could not hold the city.  After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years.  The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions.  Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times.  In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East.  Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years.  Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day.  Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed.  But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long period of decline.  The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year.

What is the extent of the damage?
Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes.  The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service.  The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas.  "We feel much better about this fire today," as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service.  He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds.  The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday.  Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters.  Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer.  Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said.  On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported.  The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire.  "My house is right through here, though it may be gone," Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire.  Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire.  "I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture," Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock.  "As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around."

What is the vampires name?
Suddenly, Amy screamed. I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away. His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off. The dancers near us tried to clear some space. He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back. He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that itâ€™s too late to save itself. A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up. On the floor was Dvorovâ€™s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood. Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand. It flashed in the strobe where it wasnâ€™t streaked with Dvorovâ€™s blood. â€œHe wasnâ€™t the only one with a secret or two,â€ he said by way of explanation. â€œYou spotted our boy, didnâ€™t you? I bet his hide-out is nearby, too. Letâ€™s hurry.â€ He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip. The crowd parted for us. The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us. In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room. â€œCome on!â€ shouted Nepthys. We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held.

I bet his hide-out is nearby, too. Letâ€™s hurry.â€ He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip. The crowd parted for us. The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us. In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room. â€œCome on!â€ shouted Nepthys. We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held.

What was the weapon used to separate Dvorov's head from his body?
Suddenly, Amy screamed. I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away. His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off. The dancers near us tried to clear some space. He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back. He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that itâ€™s too late to save itself. A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up.

Physical properties include the state of matter.  We know these states as solid, liquid, or gas.  Properties can also include color and odor.  For example, oxygen is a gas.  It is a major part of the air we breathe.  It is colorless and odorless.  Chlorine is also a gas.  In contrast to oxygen, chlorine is greenish in color.  It has a strong, sharp odor.  Have you ever smelled cleaning products used around your home?  If so, you have probably smelled chlorine.  Another place you might smell chlorine is at a public swimming pool.  The chlorine is used to kill bacteria that may grow in the water.  Other physical properties include hardness, freezing, and boiling points.  Some substances have the ability to dissolve in other substances.  Some substances cannot be dissolved.  For example, salt easily dissolves in water.  Oil does not dissolve in water.
