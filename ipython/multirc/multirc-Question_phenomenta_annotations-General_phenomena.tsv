 //Sent 1: Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. //Sent 2: He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. //Sent 3: In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western "occupation" of Islamic lands. //Sent 4: Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. //Sent 5: In ensuing weeks, Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off "the head of the snake." //Sent 6: By this time, Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. //Sent 7: Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. //Sent 8: Some of Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. //Sent 9: For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. //Sent 10: The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. //Sent 11: Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. //Sent 12: There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. //Sent 13: In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label "al Qaeda operations" too often in these early years. //Sent 14: Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. //Sent 15: And in this network, Bin Laden's agenda stood out. //Sent 16: While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya, Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the "far enemy"-the United States. //Sent 17: After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction. //Sent 18: In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans.

 //Sent 1: Peace and Prosperity: After years of government propaganda predicting the worst atrocities, most Japanese civilians were surprised at the warmth and friendliness of the occupying forces. //Sent 2: The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. //Sent 3: To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japanâ€™s institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. //Sent 4: Article 9 renounced Japanâ€™s right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a â€œself-defenseâ€ force. //Sent 5: The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japanâ€™s militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. //Sent 6: The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. //Sent 7: The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japanâ€™s future stunning economic success. //Sent 8: Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japanâ€™s auto industry back on its feet. //Sent 9: Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. //Sent 10: This included transistor technologyâ€‚â€”â€‚invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applicationsâ€‚â€”â€‚for the surreal sum of $25,000. //Sent 11: It was Japan that produced the worldâ€™s first transistor radio. //Sent 12: The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. //Sent 13: Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. //Sent 14: The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the governmentâ€™s loving attentions. //Sent 15: Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. //Sent 16: By the end of the decade, Japanâ€™s was the third largest economy in the worldâ€‚â€”â€‚less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. //Sent 17: Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by â€œdirtyâ€ industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. //Sent 18: The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions.
