Hewas watching three TV shows that night.  First, was Muffins the Cat.  The second show wasErnie the Talking Donkey.  The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster.  His Mom told himto go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen.  He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed allnight.  First about sheep jumping fences.  Second about playing fetch the ball withRuffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourthabout his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal.Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired.  His Mom calledhim and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Rufflesthe dog to lick him in the face.  Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.  Then hequickly dressed into his uniform.  He was yawning.His Mom drove him to the soccer field.  The game had started.  Douglas had to sit out thefirst quarter.  His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions.Douglas started the second quarter.  He was tired and could not keep up with the rest ofhis team.  The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow.  Usually he was fast.

While the coach gave energy drinks to theteam, Douglas fell asleep.  The third quarter started.Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in.  When he saw Douglas was sleeping,he sent Billy into the game.  Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game twoto two.  Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face.  Douglasgot up and stretched.  He was finally well rested.  The coach saw Douglas and sent himinto the game.  Douglas remembered his dream.  In the last second, he headed the ball inthe goal like Pele. He won the game. The team cheered.Since that time, Douglas goes to bed on time.

What was I doing on this day at the beginning of the story?
It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pullingweeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake sosometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and itmakes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming inor near the lake.On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my gardenand walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talkingin a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all ofthe time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" toother lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried andshort. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this soundwas not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spotanything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totallygiven up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was itcoming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around tothe other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it isnot a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a fatherlake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eatfish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby toswim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt veryspecial that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun thangardening.

When did Wolfie purr?
Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had reallywanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and likedto blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become aknight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a goodname for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  Hepurred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret'smother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog thebathroom and they clanked.So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when hestood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to getWolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He hada Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.

Todd's dad told him he had to try his hardest. If he did, then Todd's dad would watch him swim every day. If Todd wanted to try and get to the rock, his dad would follow him there to make sure he was safe. Todd's dad wrote this down in his notebook so he wouldn't forget.After a week, Todd made his first try to get to the rock, and his dad followed him like he said he would. Todd didn't make it to the rock before he got tired and had to turn around. He practiced even harder for the next two weeks and wanted to try again.

What scared Mortamer?
Mortamer was a tree monkey who lived in the jungles of Brazil with his parents, and their pet snail, Johnson.  They lived in a grass house built in the very tops of the trees, so high that they could see the whole jungle from their front porch. One day, Mortamer and his parents were outside hunting for food and the sky turned black! The sun was gone, hidden behind giant black clouds! Big winds shook the very trees of the forest, scaring poor little Mortamer who had turned 7 years old yesterday. Then, without warning, the sun was back! It was bright and sunny, and jungle birds were singing with all the other jungle animals.  Little Mortamer and his parents quickly went back to their tree, only to find something very sad!  Their poor little house lay on the ground, smashed to pieces!  The wind knocked it down!  Little Mortamer was very sad, and started to cry.  His parents smiled, and started to pick up the pieces.  Other monkeys came by to help, too.  Soon everyone was fixing Mortamer's house, and he was a very happy monkey.

Why did the airport finally let Jackson come?
Hannah Harvey was a ten year old that had many friends in school.  She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer.  One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her.  She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces.  Even Jackson, Hannah's dog, was acting different.  Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange. Hannah's father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move.  Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal.  Then, Hannah's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya.  Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there.  As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah's mother calmed her with a gentle touch.  Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah's mother. Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes.  She did not know the next time she would be home.  She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, Susan. Susan did not quite understand where Kenya was, but promised to visit Hannah. The next day, Hannah boarded a plane with her family. At first, they thought that Jackson could not come with them.  However, Hannah worked hard and helped make sure that he had all of his shots so that he could come. After he had them all, the airport said it was OK for Jackson to come!  The Harvey family left and off they went across the ocean to begin their new life in Kenya.

They named the dog Roxy and went out and bought their new puppy bowls, leashes, a dog house, and food.  They were so excited to finally have a dog of their own.  Every day they would make sure they fed Roxy and took really good care of her.  Sue really like brushing her hair and Jason really liked walking her.  They loved their puppy.  One day their puppy got out and ran away.  They looked for Roxy all day.   They were so sad.  They felt as if they did not take good care of their new puppy and that is why their puppy left.  Their mom told them that it would be okay and that they would put lost signs out for the puppy.  Jason and Sue got crayons. Sue colored a picture of their new puppy. Jason then put their number on the sign.  They then went down the block and hung pictures on poles and after getting all the signs out, they went home to wait to see if someone would call.  It did not take long.  They had a call that the puppy was found.  It was their neighbor Henry.  The puppy had followed him in as he was walking to his house.  He had never seen the puppy before and knew it must be lost.  Sue and Jason were so happy to have their puppy back.  They went in the house, fed the puppy, and laid down to watch a movie.  When their mom walked in to tell them to go to bed, they were both snuggled with the puppy, sound asleep.

One day, Lucy was taking her dog to the park when she saw a big ice cream truck. It did not look like other ice cream trucks she had seen before, so she rushed to look at it. Inside, she saw that this truck had many different flavors of ice cream that the other trucks didn't have.This truck had chocolate, strawberry, banana and even mint flavors!She wanted to get some ice cream, but when she got to the truck she saw that she had no money.She remembered then that she left it at home.

How did the girl hurt her knee?
There once was a little old lady who had no friends. She rode her bike to and from the store and didn't say hello to anyone along the way. One day she saw a little girl crying in the street. No one else was around to take care of the girl so the little old lady stopped her bike and asked the girl, "What is wrong, Dear?" The little girl said, "I hurt my knee when I fell down!" "Oh dear!" cried the little old lady and bent down and looked at the girl's knee. "It looks to me like you have a scrape," she said. The little girl cried and the little old lady said, "Don't worry, all boo-boos hurt a little but it's the medicine that makes it go away." The little old lady bent down and blew on the girl's knee and whispered, "Go away, go away, no boo-boos here today!" The little girl smiled and that little old lady found her first friend.

How does the family deal with Dillon's odd food liking?
The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

What does Kacey do and what bad thing happens because of it?
Kacey was a princess living in a magical kingdom with her parents and two little brothers. One day a monster bashed down the door to the castle when Kacey wasn't home and grabbed her youngest brother. "Give me your jewels or I eat him!" the monster yelled. Kacey's mom and dad called for the guards, but the monster bashed them down. "Give me my jewels!" the monster said. "Or I'll eat your other son too!" Kacey got home to see the big back of the monster in the door. "What do I do?" Kacey thought. Then she remembered a move she had seen a fighter use at the fair she had gone to. She also remembered she could lift a thousand pounds. "I know!" She ran up behind the monster, grabbed him around the waist and lifted. She picked the monster up into the air, then slammed him down on his head. He didn't move, and Kacey smiled at her parents. Then she saw their sad faces. Oh no! She had squashed her little brother.

So, the boy went to a music store with his parents. When he got there he didn't know where to start, so the boy walked up to the front and asked the man who worked there for help.

Right before they are finished picking their flowers to surprise their mother, the girls see that the clouds in the sky have turned grey and that the sun is no longer shining. It looks like it's going to rain soon.Abby looks down at her small hand of purple flowers and frowns."What's wrong, Abby?" Emma asks, turning to look at her sister studying her flowers. "Well," Abby says, "We got the flowers, but it looks like rain."Emma looks up at the cloudy sky and nods."If it rains, we can't make mommy a mud pie," Abby adds with sadness. Emma looks down at her own white flowers, counting them, and thinks. After making sure she had four flowers, she looks at Abby with an idea. "What if we get the mud and take it in the house? That way if it rains, we can still make a cake," Emma says. "Good idea!" Abby smiles, happy again. Flowers in hand, the girls grab a yellow pail, placing their flowers on the porch, as they walk towards the mud to get what they need for their mother's birthday cake.

Emma looks down at her own white flowers, counting them, and thinks. After making sure she had four flowers, she looks at Abby with an idea. "What if we get the mud and take it in the house? That way if it rains, we can still make a cake," Emma says. "Good idea!" Abby smiles, happy again. Flowers in hand, the girls grab a yellow pail, placing their flowers on the porch, as they walk towards the mud to get what they need for their mother's birthday cake.

What did the town leader ask the dad to do?
Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods.  This family had always lived in the woods.  Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town.  The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children.  The dad and his family had a good life.  They never wanted for much. The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town. One day there came a nasty storm to the woods.  This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city.  Many homes were under water.  The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back.  The logs would be used to build a wall. The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find.  In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children.

What was the color of the toy car?
One day a young boy went to visit a toy store. In the toy store the young boy found many fun toys. One toy that the boy really liked was a small blue toy truck. The small blue toy truck was a lot of fun to play with, and made a lot of funny noises. The young boy played with the toy truck for a long time, and then another little boy showed up and began to play with a little red car. The two boys ended up becoming friends and played with the toys for a long time. They ended up becoming good friends and had many play dates together over the months ahead. On one play date the two boys built a large tree house and called it the tree castle. They played for hours in the tree castle and always found something fun to do when they played together. They were glad that they met in the toy store and became life-long friends.

Who did the boy ask to help him with his choice?
One day a boy was looking for a school lunch in the fridge. He was looking for something that was good for him, but also something that tasted good. He was going to school, and needed something to keep him going and doing well in class. Recently he had been eating cookies for lunch, and was tired by the end of the day. The cookies came from the school lunchroom, and his mom didn't know about them. Finally he got tired of cookies and thought he needed something good for him. So, he asked his mom to come help him out. First he got a doughnut. "That's not good for you at all!" said his mom. So, his mom got a big bag of broccoli. "Yuk, I hate the taste of broccoli," said the boy. They looked and looked and couldn't find anything that looked good to the boy that was also good for him. Finally, they saw the perfect thing: some grilled chicken from the party on the weekend. It was so delicious the first time, and it tasted great cold for lunch. The chicken had the types of food he needed to get through the day.

This is a story of a girl and what kind of animal?
This is the story of a young girl and her dog. The young girl and her dog set out a trip into the woods one day. Upon entering the woods the girl and her dog found that the woods were dark and cold. The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods. To this day the girl does not know why the bear was so friendly and to this day she has never told anyone about the meeting with the bear in the woods.

What month was it when the cat arrived?
It was very warm for February. Anna and her brother, John, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather. Dad was washing his car. When Mom came home with the groceries, Dad sent the kids to help carry bags. They ran to the garage to help her. But when they got there, Mom was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair."Can we pet her?" Anna asked."Be careful," Mom said. Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things."She's fat," John giggled."She's not fat. She's pregnant," Mom told him."What's that mean?" John asked."It means she's going to have kittens." Anna said. "Can we keep her?" Anna begged. "Please?"Mom and Dad looked at each other."We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," Mom said. "Long-haired cats give you rashes.""But you always said you wanted one," Dad told Mom. "Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let's send her over to your parents' farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."The kids were excited. They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair. Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens. Anna named her kitten Lucky, and John named his kitten Spike. The other two kittens, Butterscotch and Squeakers, stayed at Grandma and Grandpa's house, but Anna and John each got a kitten of their very own.

How old was Josh turning?
Today is Josh's birthday, so he invited all of his friends over for his party. Josh wanted it to be the best party ever, so he helped his mom plan it so it would be fun. They first picked that it would be a pool party, since they had a huge pool in their backyard. So they told everybody to wear their bathing suits. They went to the sports store and got a basketball hoop that they could put in the pool, so people could play water basketball. Then they went to the food store and picked out all of Josh's favorite foods. They got chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs so they could cook everything on the grill. When it came time for the party, Josh's best friend Ryan was the first to get there. Soon, all of Josh's friends were there and everybody had a great time. The weather was perfect and the food was delicious. It was the best seventh birthday ever!

They had been looking forward to this for the last few days.  They had told their grandma and grandpa all about it when they saw them on Wednesday.  It was hard to sleep, they were so excited and could not wait to go.  They could not wait to get an elephant ride.  They did this last year and thought it was so fun.

Where did Lily eat dinner?
Once upon a time there was a bird named Lily. She lived in a tree with her parents. One day Lily flew to her friend Molly's tree nest, but she didn't ask for her parents' permission. They were having lots of fun playing that the time passed by so fast. They played tag. They played hide and seek. They even played racing to see who could fly the fastest. Lily's parents started to get very worried when she didn't return home for dinner. They called neighbors and friends, and even called Molly but they didn't hear the phone ringing. It wasn't until Molly's mom called her down to eat that Lily saw that it was almost past dinner time. Lily told Molly she had to go home. When Lily got home her parents were crying and very upset because they thought something happened to her. Lily felt very bad for not telling her parents, and she said she would never leave without telling them again. Her parents forgave her and sent her to bed. Lily went right to sleep.

How does John get home from school?
John was in the third grade, and nine years old. Every day he had to walk home from school. There were some kids in his class who were mean to him, and during the winter they would throw snowballs at him. John could have told the teacher, but one of the kids was a very pretty girl. She was mean, but John liked her because she was pretty and did not want her to get in trouble. One day, his teacher asked John to stay after class to wipe off the chalkboard and to empty the pencil sharpener. By the time he was done, the other kids had gone home. They could no longer throw snowballs at him. John did not mind helping out his teacher, and he soon stayed after class every day. John was not very good at math, and sometimes his teacher would help him when he stayed after school. She said if John could help her out for at least two weeks, he could pass his math class. John thought it was a good deal, and ended up being much better at math.

What type of animal did Emily and Evelyn visit first at the zoo?
Yesterday, Emily and Evelyn went to the zoo with their mom. They left the house right after breakfast so that they would be there when the zoo opened. Once inside, they raced to see the monkeys swinging around their cages. There were even two baby monkeys!  The girls also enjoyed feeding birds in the walk-in bird cage. The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them. Next, it was time to stop for ice cream. Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream. Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.  The best part of the girls' visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!

What color was Cotton's fur?
Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept.  But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. "What are you doing, Cotton?!" "I only wanted to be more like you". Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. "Don't ever do that again, Cotton!" they all cried. "Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind. I like being special".

What did Cotton do to herself that made her mommy and sisters laugh?
Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept.  But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. "What are you doing, Cotton?!" "I only wanted to be more like you". Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. "Don't ever do that again, Cotton!" they all cried. "Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind. I like being special".

What is the purple dragon's name?
The king, Banton, stood over his men who were tired from fighting. The dragons were not as tired as the men. He could not let any more pain happen to his men. He ordered the men to run away. The men went to the village. "Everyone must run for the hills." Charlie, the purple dragon let out a roar, and sent fire into the sky from his mouth. "That's right! Run little man! Run!" Luna and Milkyway, the grey and black dragons, cheered and celebrated the win. The dragons went to the river and started eating berries, and fruits. "Now we celebrate! We have what we want! Now we won't be hungry anymore!" Charlie cheered. "Good things are sure to come from this win over the humans!"Luna, not so sure, watched the humans running for their lives.The villagers could only watch the dragons take food from their land, afraid. They went to pack their things. They would need to leave with the king, and his men. There would be no soldiers to protect them from the dragons. Men, women, and children all ran around in confusion trying to get away. Before long, the village was vacated. It was okay; the villagers found a new home in the hills.

What is Rex looking forward to about going home?
On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open. From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.

It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.

What kind of exercises did Sophie do?
When Sophie woke up that morning, she had no idea where her day was going to take her. She rolled out of bed, turned off her alarm and stretched. She wasn't feeling like herself that morning, but she wasn't sure why. Sophie thought to herself, "I slept well, I ate good food yesterday, and yet I still felt strange". Sophie stepped into the shower feeling so tired. As she toweled herself off and got dressed, she felt like she was moving very slowly. She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice, got a bowl out of the cabinet and filled it with cereal. As Sophie sat at the table to eat her breakfast, she remembered why she wasn't feeling like herself. She remembered that she didn't exercise the day before. She had spent much of the day sitting in front of her television and playing games. Sophie knew that on days that she didn't exercise, she always felt bad the next day. Sophie thought for a second, and then looked at the clock. She had time to do some jumping jacks and run outside around her house before she had to leave for the day. She put on her running shoes and went out the front door. After only a quick bit of exercise, Sophie was feeling much better. She promised herself that she would never forget to exercise again.

What did they eat at the party and what was the best part?
One day 3 friends went to a pool party that they had been excited about for a long time. The girl and her brother, who were having the party, had been planning the party for a few weeks. They had invited about 20 friends and today was the big day. The pool was decorated with balloons and there were party favors on the tables. There was also soda, cake and other snacks for everyone to enjoy. The party got started and everyone was having a very good time. They were swimming and playing and laughing.

Who went to kiss dad good night?
When I was a little boy, I could remember my mom making breakfast and dinner for us. And I remember one night, when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work. On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school. I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him drop hot sauce on that chicken breast and eat every bite.When I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my dad for burning the chicken breast. I'll never forget what he said. "Dear, I love burnt chicken breast."Later that night, I went to kiss daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his chicken breast burnt.

Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground.  There was a low part that became a pond after it rained.  The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn't find a buyer for another house.  The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot.  There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.  There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris. Cindy said, "I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here."  Tony said, "That's a good idea.  Can I use your phone when you're done?"Cindy said "Sure!  Keep it for now.

Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground.  There was a low part that became a pond after it rained.  The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn't find a buyer for another house.  The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot.  There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.  There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris. Cindy said, "I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here."  Tony said, "That's a good idea.  Can I use your phone when you're done?"Cindy said "Sure!  Keep it for now.  I'm going to go on the jump path.  I was scared to try it last time.  I don't want to break my phone if I fall.  I'm leaving my backpack here, too.""Okay." said Tony.  "I'll watch.  You'll do good."

She told him with a smile that it was snow. Henry was not sure what snow was, but got excited when she told him that it meant that he did not have to go to school that day. Henry asked his mom if he could play in snow and she told him yes. She got him dressed in warm clothes and took him outside and taught him how to build a snowman. She also taught him how to sled down the small hill in their yard. Henry had so much fun that day he fell asleep early and had dreams about the fun white snow that fell that day hoping he could have fun the next day as well.

Who was the main character flying a kite with?
Flying a kite can be dangerous. When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dadto fly my new kite. We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind. It took usalmost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky,the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. Iflew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. Thepark was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all theway out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fellcloser to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I couldland on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, wheremy dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home.

What did some of the class get to take home, other than stories?
The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from theirschool. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who livedthere were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, theywould plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where theyended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. TheNixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kepta few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk fromtheir cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. Allthe kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearbyhills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were manygoats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to playwith their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did withtheir dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads andtiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. Theywere a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought backstories for all the rest of the school to hear.

The farmers who livedthere were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, theywould plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where theyended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. TheNixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kepta few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk fromtheir cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. Allthe kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearbyhills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were manygoats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to playwith their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did withtheir dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads andtiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. Theywere a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought backstories for all the rest of the school to hear.

Where did the child go when he saw the butterflies?
I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There,we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I sawmonkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  Infact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where therewere lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar waterto feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, butI was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flyingeverywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They saidbutterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in theroom.Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at meto stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said Iwas sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out ofthere!I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not beafraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for mybrother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and findbutterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on meand I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!

What type of job was NOT in the story?
There was once a land named Catatonia where cats ran things. Cats walked and talked muchas you do except they walked on four legs. There were cat policemen, cat firemen, catteachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.   The King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs. He had two brothers named Pouncer andFlash who helped him rule in Catatonia. Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Creamcenter and Flash's job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure allthe cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in thedistance.    One day Pouncer's wife brought the kittens to see Pouncer at his office. There were whitekittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the Milk, Cheese andCream center.

She had not been getting much sleeplately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but liedown and try to rest a little.Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept hermind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girland her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, andshe and her younger sister had their own room in the back.It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound gotlouder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the otherside of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still lookedfive years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from asickness at age five."What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the littlegirl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reachedfor her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling."She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."

What did they walk past?
The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river andfished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in thebackyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said.  "Want to go fishing?"I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and somefishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  Iasked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and thestore, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used tocatch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  Whenwe got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned andwalked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees rightat the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then wesat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about whathe and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, butsitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.

The hours were long and draining on their bodies. All the girls and boys who leftthe performance center looked so tired. They couldn't pick up their practice bags off ofthe floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy.

Based on what John likes to do, what else do you think John would enjoy?
John thought about things that he liked to do.Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at thesport. He didn't even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ballso hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazytricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quitethat good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knewthat if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play footballhimself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands,cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak atall for the rest of the day.

If the rain arrived on Saturday, what day did Stewart go to the beach?
One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. "You can talk!" he shouted. "Yes," said the bug. "Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" Stewart felt sad. "Gee," he cried. "That sounds terrible!"Stewart thought about the problem. "Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. "Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. It was the bug! "I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness." After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, "Goodbye!"

What is Marsha's noodle made out of?
Marsha loves playing with her noodle friend.  She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color.  When her mom first made it, it was white.  The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night.  Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night.  On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor.  To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him.  She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went.  Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days.  There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him!  So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times.  During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket.  At night, she puts him under her pillow.  She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him.

How did Jane get to Samantha?
Jane's doll, Samantha, was a magical doll. Jane kept Samantha hidden from her friends, even Julie, who was her best friend. Jane didn't want all the other girls from school, like Wanda and Ruth, to find out that she had a magical doll. Samantha could do things other dolls couldn't. Jane would whisper in her ear a secret word, and all of a sudden Samantha would come to life, hopping around, running all over. But Samantha did more than run, she could talk. Jane told Samantha everything, and Samantha understood. One day, Jane was naughty and lied to her mother. Jane's mother put Samantha on top of the refrigerator where Jane could not get to her. Jane was very sad. The one person she told everything to was out of her reach. The next day, Jane had one of the worst days of her life. She needed to tell someone, but Julie wasn't around. She needed Samantha. She had no ladder, chair, or stool to reach her. Julie moved the kitchen table forward towards the refrigerator, and hopped on top. She started to climb up to reach for Samantha, and grabbed her quickly. She came down, dropping Samantha on the floor, and broke Samantha. Jane whispered the secret word, but Samantha didn't awake. Samantha's powers were gone. She couldn't walk, run, talk, or listen. Jane hurt her the one person she could trust the most. Then, Samantha moved, looked at Jane, and a tear came from her eye. Samantha's eyes closed, and she was without life. She cried no more.

What broke the fence?
It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.Sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.  A tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.  He got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.  He used the wires to fix the fence.Now, it was time to catch the crook.  Sure enough, he saw tracks heading to and from the fence.  But they weren't a crook's footprints.  It had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard.

It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.Sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.  A tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.  He got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.  He used the wires to fix the fence.Now, it was time to catch the crook.  Sure enough, he saw tracks heading to and from the fence.  But they weren't a crook's footprints.  It had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard.

When am I going to get a hamster?
I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks, or maybe a month! I have been waiting for a hamster for years, so I don't want to wait another day! She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat, or even sleep in. My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning, as hamsters are nervous, but we're going to end up being best friends. She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework. When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home. I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth. I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble, too. Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away. Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt.  I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart.

Where did Jenny want to go on a trip to?
Jenny was standing on a rock.  Suddenly, she had to sneeze.  After she sneezed, she walked away.  She finally got to the park and saw her daddy.  Her daddy gave her some milk.  Jenny drank the milk in a big hurry.  She loved milk.  She walked over and turned a switch.  She walked to the lake.  Jenny was in a big hurry and went really fast.  She got to the lake and sat down.  Jenny began thinking.  Jenny wanted to go on a trip to Florida.  Jenny did not want to go someplace cold.  Jenny did not want to go to the moon.

What was the second thing the squirrel passed?
Thunder can move a seesaw. This is very important to know if you ever see what I saw. One day, I was walking home when I saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house. It was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself. Suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere. It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. The squirrel fell and fell for a long time. Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. "Where were you?" the ox asked, "Just talking with a friend," answered the mouse. I was watching and listening to everything, so I stayed, waiting. Soon enough, a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away. So, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.

What was the dog's name?
Pester came running into the room. He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. He'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. That still confused him. He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. And it was so hairy. It was a like a mop that could run around. He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it. She was kind of cute for a dog, Pester thought to himself. He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. He tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.

After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.

What did Pester wave to get Maggie's attention?
Pester came running into the room. He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. He'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. That still confused him. He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. And it was so hairy. It was a like a mop that could run around.

What did Jimmy eat?
Jimmy swam around the pond. He was a duck. He was wet, but he was a duck and didn't care. He ate some bugs. He saw some worms on the bottom, but wasn't interested in them, or in the bread crumbs, or the hot dog the boy had dropped. He kept on swimming and swimming. He was a mess. After he had eaten his food, it was afternoon. The sun was setting, and Jimmy wanted to rest in the sun, and sleep. He found a nice place to sit, and began to rest. Falling asleep quickly, he slept for a few hours. When he woke up it was dark outside. He had missed dinnertime, but there were always those worms at the bottom of the pond. Jimmy ate quickly, and was soon ready to swim more. The pond was small, not a lake, or a river or a stream. He swam around for a little longer, and soon it was ready for bed in the nest, where he slept with his family Billy, Susie, and Doug. The other animals were sleeping as well, the dog and the cat on the porch. The cow was sleeping in the barn. And last the kittens in their box. Jimmy was ready for bed, it had been a long day, and the next day was going to be the same. But Jimmy did not care. He loved being a duck. Jimmy was one happy duck.

Where did Kevin and Erin NOT visit?
There once was a guy named Kevin and girl named Erin.  They really liked spending time together.  One day, Kevin traveled from his home in the United States of America to Erin's house in England.  They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world.  They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights.  They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains.  Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there.  Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people.  After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land.  They saw everything from the mountains to forests.  They even got to visit the beach!  Because they had so much fun, Kevin returned home with Erin to England where they hung out and spent the next few days and months talking about all of the neat things they saw and did on their trip.

What would Tony and Ally rather do?
Tommy and Suzy (brother and sister) went to the playground one afternoon with their mom and dad, Jan and Dean. They were playing a game of tag and having the best time ever running after each other and laughing. They liked to play tag instead of building sandcastles or swinging. They liked tag because they liked to run. They like to play hopscotch or jump rope but that day they wanted to play tag. Other games aren't as fun. They met Tony and Ally (who are best friends) and invited them to play tag too. Tony and Ally like to play other games like hopscotch or jump rope but that day they joined the game of tag. Making new friends is important. Tony and Ally would rather make friends than play their favorite games.

Why did the witch give Ellen her voice back?
Princess Ellen wanted nothing more than to be a singer when she grew up. She had a beautiful voice and everyone who heard it said she was the best singer in the land. But her uncle believed singing would keep her from her job as princess, so he found a witch and paid her to steal Princess Ellen's voice. The witch made a spell which gave Ellen the witch's voice. The spell also gave Ellen's voice to the witch. The witch went on to become famous as a singer, and Ellen grew up to be Queen. One day Queen Ellen heard of a singer who was the best in the land. She went to hear this singer, and was surprised to hear her own voice coming from the woman on stage. When the show was over, Ellen found the singer and gave her a penny.  Ellen told the singer, "You have a magical voice". The witch was so touched by Ellen's kindness, that she gave Ellen her voice back.

What color was the moon?
One day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land. Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! The pink moon felt so lonely. So, the pink moon called on the sun for help. The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon! What are you doing here? Don't you know the sky is my home during the day? Your time is coming soon enough. Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun. "But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me. Please let me join your light during the day this once!" By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart. The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here. Come to me now. Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!" So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun. At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun! The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun! All the lizards, cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon! But at that time, the sun slipped away, saying "Farewell, pink moon. We have to do this again!" And so, every few years, the sun and moon come together to show the pink moon's is always with us, even in the day time .

What is the name of the band?
Three cats named Daisy, Sofia, and Abby wanted to start a band. They put an ad in the newspaper because they needed a drummer. Daisy and Sofia would play guitar and sing. Bass would be played by Abby. A few weeks passed and no one called about the ad. Finally, one afternoon the telephone rang. A deep voice said, "Do you still need a drummer?" Daisy said, "Yes, come by this afternoon." Daisy got the other cats together and they set up their instruments and waited for the drummer to show up. Soon a dog came running up, pulling a set of drums behind him. "You're the drummer?" Sofia hissed. "Scram!" said Abby. But Daisy was more accepting. "C'mon guys, we need a drummer. Just let him play!" she said. "Okay," said Sofia and Abby. They started to jam. "We need to come up with a name," Sofia said, between songs. "How about 'Atomic Death Fish?'" said Abby. "No, too scary," said Sofia. "How about 'Monkeys on Mars?'" said Daisy. "Too goofy," said Sofia. "How about 'Sofia and the No Nos?'" said the drummer. "I love it!" everyone said.

Who did Mike play games with at the park?
Mike wanted to make a cake for his Mom's birthday. His dad was going to help him. Mike had eggs, milk, and flour at his house, but no sugar! Dad told Mike to take his bicycle to the store so he could buy sugar for the cake. On his way to the store, Mike saw his friend, Sally, at the park. He rode over to say hello. Mike and Sally played lots of games at the park. After a long time, Mike saw it was starting to get dark. He needed to hurry if he was going to make it to the store and get home before night time. Mike rode as fast as he could, and made it to the store. The store was really big, but Mike found the sugar really fast. When Mike was on his way to the front of the store to pay for the sugar, he saw a toy he had been wanting for a long time. But Mike only had enough money to pay for the sugar or the toy. Mike didn't know what to do! The cake would taste good and would make his mom happy. But, the toy was so cool! Mike bought the sugar for his mom's cake, because she was always so nice to him. He could always get the toy another time.2. What did Mike find at the store that he wanted to buy

What type of birds did I see in my yard?
One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup.

What was the name of the man next door?
Sammy loved playing baseball. He would play every day, even if there was no practice that day! One day, Sammy went to the park with his mom to play catch with his friends, but as he was playing, he tripped over a rock, and his shoe slipped off! His shoe went flying into the air, high up into the sky, and Sammy watched as the shoe fell into old man Mr. Grumpy's yard. What was he going to do? His mom sat on a bench not too far away, reading a book. "Should I tell Mom?" Sammy thought to himself. He thought that maybe he shouldn't, because he might get in trouble. Instead, he was going to climb the fence into Mr. Grumpy's yard!"What, are you crazy?" Sammy's friend Billy said when he told him what he was going to do. Billy didn't seem to like the idea. "Mr. Grumpy is a mean old man, and he'll yell at you for sure. I think you need to tell your mom!" With that, Billy ran off to tell Sammy's mom!Sammy ran after Billy, trying to get him to stop, but Billy told the whole story before Sammy could get there. After Sammy's mom heard the story, she took Sammy by the hand and said, "Come on, Sammy, let's go get your shoe!" Sammy was worried. What was she going to do?Sammy's mom took him straight to mean old Mr. Grumpy's door, and knocked on it. "Oh no!" thought Sammy, "He's going to yell at me!" But the man who opened the door was a nice old man, and he smiled at little Sammy, and let them get his shoe. That's when Sammy learned that it's always better to be honest.

Why was Paul excited?
Paul woke up to the sun shining in his eyes. He was so excited! Today was the big day for the baseball game and he was very excited! He rolled out of bed and jumped in the shower, whistling a happy song. Downstairs he could hear his baby brother, Mike, crying and he had to giggle to himself. He got out of the shower and pulled on his clothes. He looked at the calendar on his desk and smiled knowing yesterday, Friday, had been the last day of school. "Hi, Mom! No school Monday," he laughed. He gave his baby brother a kiss on the cheek and grabbed a piece of bacon. "Is that all you are eating, Paul? You need to have a good meal before you leave." said mom. "Yes, I am meeting John and Terry at the playground and I am late."  He grabbed his glove and bat and ran outside, right into a mud puddle from last night's rain. He got to the playground and John was wiping his head. "Whew, it is very hot now!" "It is going to be a hot summer since it was so cold this winter. It is hard to believe last month there was snow on the ground." The boys jogged to the playing field and shook hands with the other boys. "This is going to be a great game, the first of the summer." one of the boys said. The game started and everyone had a turn. Paul's team was behind by two points. Terry took his place at the plate. "Batter up!" The pitcher threw the first ball. "STRIKE ONE!" Then the second and crack, the bat hit the ball and it flew through the air. Terry ran to the first base. Next, John hit the ball with the first throw and he ran to first base and Terry stole third base. The third player was Joey, a red headed boy. He was not a very good player and he missed the ball three times. "OUT." He was followed by George and he also made an out. Up came Tiny. He hit the ball and made it to first base, John moved to second and Terry stayed on third. CRACK! HOME RUN! Paul ran around the bases and Terry, John, and Tiny all made it in. Paul saved the game and the day! Paul's team won the first game of the summer!

How many different places does Nana hide the money BEFORE she hides it for the final time?
Nana had a bunch of money.  She had saved money her whole life.  But Nana was afraid of people stealing her money.  She planned to hide it.  First she moved it around in her house and hid it behind a wall.  Then she put her money in the attic.  But she still didn't feel safe about her money.  She was sure someone would find it.  Finally she took it outside and started digging in the ground.  She buried it in the ground so no one would find it.  "It is going be safe here," said Nana.  She was very pleased that she had hidden her money so well.  The next day after breakfast, she went outside to make sure her money was still there.  She stopped at the spot she thought she had buried it and began digging.  After some time she hadn't found it.  She climbed out of the hole and looked around.  She had used a tree as a way to mark the spot.  But she couldn't tell which tree. The wind was blowing and the trees all looked the same! She had used a brown spot on the ground to mark the spot. But she couldn't tell which brown spot it was!  She knew she wasn't lost.  Nana had hidden her money so well that no one could find it, and that included her!

What color are the eggs?
The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up. A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest. She laid four eggs yesterday, some white and some spotted. She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born. Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow. Little "cheeping" sounds could be heard coming from inside, and soon the eggs cracked open. Featherless baby birds were inside, crying for food. The mother had nothing to give, so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food. She saw some worms wiggling in the ground. She picked a few up with her beak and flew them up to the nest. The babies were well fed with the worms, and the mother kept them all warm in the cold spring morning. Mr. Bird came home to find his new babies, and they were all a happy family.

Why did we go to the park every Saturday?
Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.

Why does Tim start out so far behind?
"I don't think I can win the race" Tim told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked "Why not?" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. Tim answered, "I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess." "Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?" Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.

How did Josie get the soil in her garden ready for planting?
Josie started planning her new garden in the winter. She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area. She looked through the seed magazines. She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower. She talked to a friend about her plans. It seemed like the snow would never melt.But Josie didn't have to wait for spring to get started. Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow. Finally spring arrived. Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil. She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better. When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden. The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow.

What kind of sandwiches did Bill and Sarah have?
Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer. Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.

What three bad things does a lion have that scare other animals?
Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends. Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky. They don't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends. Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt. When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend. A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous. It's not easy to be friends with a lion, but a friendship takes time and a lot of hard work and that's what is most important! Also, my auntie always told me to be strong like a lion but to always be nice. Having big teeth, sharp claws, and being cranky is not good, and we need to work hard to be the opposite of that to make sure we keep our friends.

What was in the field?
Joe's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows, chickens, and ducks. Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself. Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm. Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that. Joe looked at his father and said, "I wanted to be like you." Joe's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor. Joe did and after he got a bandage on his arm, he and his father rode in the field on the tractor.

What did Joe's father tell him not to do?
Joe's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows, chickens, and ducks. Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself. Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm.

What made the cat's tongue feel better?
The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along. The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together. The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard. He thought to himself that he wouldn't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it. He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he couldn't smell anything. Not even water. Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye. He ran to it. He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle. The cat took a big drink. It made his tongue felt so much better that it made him want to sing, but the others were done and the bird had flown away.

What does the clerk first do upon Trevor and his mom entering the candy shop?
I stepped inside my mother's car and dropped my backpack on the floor as my face filled with excitement. Today's the day that we're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner. Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try. I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out. He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he's going to give us a sale, so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off. Actually, the clerk ends up cutting it half off! We thanked him and went on our way as I tried not to eat all the way home.

How many of Mikes friends came to the party
John wanted to have a birthday party for his son, Mike. John and his wife Sara knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter Jane. So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party. When the clown arrived, ten of Mikes friends showed up to watch the show. His parents had sent out 12 invites, thinking 6 or 8 kids would come. The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John's face. This caused John's face to turn red. After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party. There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles. Since it was Mike's birthday they let him choose. He really wanted pizza so they called up Pizza Palace to place their order. When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas. Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen. John gave everybody a slice and then placed Mike in his lap to eat dinner.

What did Joey eat for breakfast?
Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey. Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy. Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie! Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey's mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed.

Who is better than Jake at baseball?
Jake was walking to the park to play baseball with his friends.  He loved being outside on sunny days, and now that school was over for the year, he was playing baseball every day.  The more he played, the better he got.  Only Frank was better than he was.  He liked playing third base, but he often played in the field.  He was carrying his favorite mitt that his Grandfather had bought him.  His Grandfather had taught him to catch.  He loved spending time with him when he was younger, but he had moved last year.  Now he only saw his Grandfather in the summer.  Jake was really excited to show him his skills when he came to their next game.  He could throw really fast now.  He was sure his Grandfather would want to sit in the front to watch him.  He knew he would jump up and down.  Jake happily ran the rest of the way to the park thinking about how much fun he was going to have playing baseball this year.

What did Sally do when she got home?
Sally the cat went outside to play. First she went on the trail to the river. Sally sat and watched the fish. She wanted to catch a fish. The fish swam away too fast. Next she went to the field. Sally laid down in the grass and took a nap. There's nothing like a cat nap on a warm day. When Sally woke up she saw a mouse. Sally ran after the mouse and tried to catch it. The mouse ran into a hole and got away. "That's okay" Sally said. "I'll get him next time." Sally went back to the trail and began to walk home. When she got back to the river she took a drink of water. "This water tastes good" said Sally. When she got back to her house, Sally went inside and ate a cat treat.

Why did the little monkey jump in the girl's backpack?
There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. He was quieter than the others too. He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him. Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.One day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going "jingle jingle." He started to feel tired. But the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise. They were yelling and banging things together. The little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet.Finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. He hung it on a branch. Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. He waited. He was very quiet and small. He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. She was with her mother and father. Then he jumped into her red backpack. He was so small that she didn't know he was there. The girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.When the girl got home, she set down her backpack. Her brother thought he saw her backpack moving. Her sister thought she heard something. But nobody knew that a tiny, sleepy monkey had come home from the zoo. He was happily sleeping in the girl's backpack in her quiet house, away from all the other noisy monkeys.

Their mother told them they could go to the library every Tuesday for their story time. They packed up the car and drove to the library, ready for a fun morning.When they arrived to the story room, there were lots of other children their age, all sitting cross-legged and ready for the story of the day. The teacher told them they would be reading "The Wild Horse". She began to tell the story of Majestic, the wild horse who could not be calmed. His people had tried and tried to break him, but he was wild at heart. Every time they took him to the river to drink, he would run straight into the water and get soaking wet! He would splash and play until he was ready to go back home, where he would sleep for hours, having worn himself out playing.

What time did the party start?
It was Sally's birthday. She was very excited. She was going to have a sleepover at her house for her birthday. She invited all of her best friends. The party was at 1 on Saturday. Jessica, Erin, and Cathy all arrived at 1, but Jennifer was late. She did not come until 2, because she could not find her other shoe. The first thing they all did was go swimming in her pool. They had so much fun. They played with the foam noodles in the pool. Erin accidentally kicked Jennifer's leg in the pool. After they swam, everyone rinsed off and went inside. They ate cake, opened presents, and watched TV. After it got dark, they ran up and down the stairway, played telephone, and told spooky stories. Sally tripped going down the stairs and hurt her foot, but it felt better soon after. Cathy got scared when they were telling stories, and wanted to call her mom to go home.

Whose birthday is it?
It was Sally's birthday. She was very excited. She was going to have a sleepover at her house for her birthday. She invited all of her best friends. The party was at 1 on Saturday. Jessica, Erin, and Cathy all arrived at 1, but Jennifer was late. She did not come until 2, because she could not find her other shoe. The first thing they all did was go swimming in her pool.

What else happened to Jamie along with breaking his watch?
Jamie was on the playground. As he was running towards his friends, he tripped on a classmate's toy truck and fell. He skinned his knee. He got up and saw that the watch that his brother had given him had broken when he fell. Jamie was very sad about his watch breaking, which was the second bad thing to happen to him today. One of his friends saw that he had fallen. Lindsay heard Jamie saying that his watch was broken. He was mad at the boy, Kevin, who had left his truck on the playground for Jamie to fall over. Lindsay tried to tell him that it was not his Kevin's fault that Jamie had fallen. She said, "Let's take your watch to the teacher. I think Miss Henderson can fix it." Miss Henderson fixed Jamie's watch, and told him to be more careful when he was running outside. After his watch was fixed and he felt better, Lindsay clapped. "I told you it would be okay," she said. She and Jamie went out to play with their other friends.

How did Asta and Sharkie become friends with the little girl?
Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta. Asta lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long.One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. "What is it?" said Asta's friend Sharkie. "It looks like a bird's belly," said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. The bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. "What does it say?" they asked. Asta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, "This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her." And that is what they did.

Who was being mean to Derek?
Derek was sad. He was playing in the school yard at recess and a girl in his class was being mean to him. Her name was Sandy. Sandy was best friends with Alexis. Alexis was nice to Derek, but Sandy kept being mean. Sandy kicked dirt at Derek and called him mean names. Alexis felt bad that her friend was so nasty to Derek. Derek knew that Sandy did not like him, so he sat down in the school yard with a big frown. All of a sudden, a stranger walked up to Derek and asked him if he wanted some rock sugar candy. He told Derek he had lots of sugar rock candy in his car in the parking lot. Derek remembered his parents telling him never to talk to strangers, so he started running away from the man. Sandy and Alexis were on the jungle gym and they saw Derek running from the stranger. They went to tell their teacher, Mrs. Mustard, who was still inside the classroom. Sandy and Alexis came into the classroom screaming for help. Derek ran into the classroom right after the girls. Mrs. Mustard looked out into the recess yard, but the stranger was gone.

What does my friends want to be?
I have a friend who is a princess of the piggies. No, really! She lives in a piggy castle and has piggy gowns and piggy balls and a piggy carriage, though no piggy crown. She loves being a princess, but sometimes it gets boring. There's only so much fun to be had walking around a castle. She likes to cook too. So sometimes, she goes to the kitchen. She has a lot of fun in the kitchen making new foods. She likes to pretend she's a cook! Someday she wants to be a piggy princess cook! One of her favorite things to cook is pea soup. She loves soup, and pea soup most of all, even if tomato is pretty good too. She doesn't like vegetable or chicken soup at all. She grows her own peas, mushes them up in the soup, and then stirs it all up with a spoon. She also cooks it on the stove. She loves to cook, and I love to eat. We're best friends!

She has a lot of fun in the kitchen making new foods. She likes to pretend she's a cook! Someday she wants to be a piggy princess cook! One of her favorite things to cook is pea soup. She loves soup, and pea soup most of all, even if tomato is pretty good too. She doesn't like vegetable or chicken soup at all. She grows her own peas, mushes them up in the soup, and then stirs it all up with a spoon. She also cooks it on the stove. She loves to cook, and I love to eat. We're best friends!

Which kitten was the leader?
There was once a group of kittens who all liked to play together. Their names were Fluffy, Snowball, Cookie Monster, and Larry. Fluffy was the leader of the group, and whatever he said, the others did. One day he said, "Hey, everybody, let's go chase some mice." Everyone said "Yes!" except Larry. Larry did not want to chase mice. Larry wanted to drink some milk. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said "too bad." So everyone went off to chase mice. The next day Fluffy said, "Hey, everybody, let's go annoy the dogs." Everyone said "Yes" except Larry. Larry thought it was a bad idea. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said, "Too bad." So everyone went off to annoy the dogs. Except Larry. When the cats annoyed the dogs, the dogs became very angry. They started growling. They caught the kittens in their paws. The kittens yelled, "Help us!" Larry heard, and he ran over and hissed at the dogs. The dogs could not see Larry, only his shadow, which looked very big. The dogs got scared and ran away, and the kittens cheered. "Yay Larry! We'll do anything you want!"

What woke Lizzie up?
The sound of the women washing laundry down at the lake woke Lizzie up. She yawned, stretching out like a lazy cat. Her sister was also awake. "Lizzie", Meghan whispered, "are you awake?" Lizzie nodded and rolled out of bed. Meghan rolled over and went back to sleep. As Lizzie walked down the hallway, she accidentally stepped on Ralph's tail. "Woof!" Ralph yelled, in pain. "Sorry, Ralph", said Lizzie. Lizzie went down the stairs and into the kitchen. She ate some milk and cereal for breakfast. Then she sat down to write a letter to her dad. As she was writing she heard Ralph playing with his ball. Lizzie's dad was a driver for a rich family in England. She had only met her dad in person once, but they wrote letters to each other every week. Her dad was a very busy man, and he did what he had to for his family. Sometimes Lizzie wished she could go to England, too. It wasn't fair that the other girls got to see their dads every day. After writing a page, Lizzie stopped. Her hand was covered in the black ink of the pen. She washed her hands and dried them. Then she went outside to wait for the postman. She would mail her letter right away.

One day Kyle's Dad had to go for a long ride. He went on this ride because he wanted to get breakfast. With breakfast the dad always loved to get a banana in a drink. This was his favorite drink. But along the ride, Kyle's dad had a scare. The back door was open but someone else shut it and tossed his book. Later he found his book in a white bin. Along with the book, there was a white costume. He thought that maybe this was a sign. So he took the white costume and found out it was a doctor costume. He remembered that his son Kyle's favorite thing to do was play doctor. This made him remember that he never even asked his son Kyle if he wanted to come for the ride.

What color did I say he was wearing?
Hi there! How are you doing today? I was hanging out with my friend earlier today. I am looking for a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants. Have you seen him? I cannot find him, and I thought I looked everywhere. I have checked behind the green couch and he was not there. I looked inside the white refrigerator and he was not there either. I looked to the left and looked to the right of the television and he was not in those places either!Where would you look for someone? Where would you look in their house? I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty. I checked in the bedroom and it was empty too! I knocked on the bathroom door and that was empty. It is easy to find him because he is in blue.Wait, what's that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they weren't? I think that could still be my friend! I'll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There's my friend! And he's wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt.

What was Grandpa's sailboat named?
It was finally summer vacation, and Josh was excited to go to his favorite place. He was heading to Florida, to visit his Grandma and Grandpa. Josh spends every summer there, and this summer would be no different! In the mornings, Josh and Grandma would plant cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots in the ground. After they would be planted, they would water and weed the garden every day. In the afternoons, Grandpa would take Josh out on the ocean in his sailboat which was named "Sea girl." Josh loved "Sea girl" and his favorite part was smelling the salty ocean air. Sometimes Josh and Grandpa would go to a beach and make sandcastles, or start digging until they found buried sea shells or other treasures. At night, Grandma and Grandpa would make dinner and they would eat outside by the pool. On special nights, Josh got to get ice cream for dessert. A lot of times, Grandma made dinner dishes that included the vegetables Josh and Grandma were growing. It was his favorite time of year. Josh couldn't wait to leave tomorrow morning!

Joe and his friends wanted to join the school's Christmas show. He asked his friends at school what would be a good idea for the Christmas show. They came up with lots of ideas but had trouble choosing which idea to use. One person wanted to do a dance show. Another person wanted to put on a play. So Joe told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper. Then he took everyone's idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea. He read the idea out loud to his friends. It said, "musical". So Joe and his friends were going to put on a musical.The first thing Joe did was give each of his friends a different job. Jane, Rick, and Peter would be the singers in the show. Max and Sam would set up the stage and the lights. Marsha and Tammy would make the costumes. Later, Joe wanted more singers so he added Sam and Marsha as singers.On the day of the school Christmas show, the school loved the musical and cheered for Joe and his friends when it ended.

What did Sarah say about the pears after she ate one?
One day, a dad and his daughter, named Sarah, went on a trip to pick pears from a tree. Sarah was wearing a pretty pink shirt and her dad was wearing a green shirt. Sarah's dad gave her a hug as they walked to the pear tree. When they picked pears, Sarah's dad had to lift her on his back, because she could not reach the pears high in the tree. Sarah and her dad picked thirty four in five hours! Sarah was hungry, so her dad said she could eat one of the pears they picked. While she was eating, she didn't say a word, but after she was done she said it was very tasty.  She said it was green and squishy so she needed a towel to wipe her face after she was done eating.  When they got home, Sarah's grandmother told her how proud she was of her granddaughter for picking all of the pears from the tree.  As Sarah was standing in the kitchen, watching her mom and sister put thirty three pears in the freezer, she thought about how much fun she had picking pears.

While she was eating, she didn't say a word, but after she was done she said it was very tasty.  She said it was green and squishy so she needed a towel to wipe her face after she was done eating.  When they got home, Sarah's grandmother told her how proud she was of her granddaughter for picking all of the pears from the tree.  As Sarah was standing in the kitchen, watching her mom and sister put thirty three pears in the freezer, she thought about how much fun she had picking pears.

Which animal was the friendliest?
A young mother had a child that was in kindergarten. One day, the class took a trip to the zoo. This was the start of a very good day. The child had a lot of fun. The animals were very friendly, and the friendliest of all was a baby tiger, which the child called 'kitty'. The mother laughed when her child asked to see a unicorn. Instead, she gave her daughter a cookie and they had some ham sandwiches for lunch. They had lunch by the stone benches in the park area. There was a trashcan nearby. The mother threw their trash in the trashcan when they were done. Then they went to go see the pigs. The pigs made a noise like 'oink'. There were also cows. There was also a slide. The slide was a water slide, and the child begged her mother to let her go down it. At the end of the day, the child was dirty and tired, but she had a lot of fun.

Why is it hard to celebrate my birthday?
When it is the end of school and the weather is warmer, that is a beautiful time called summer. Summer is wonderful because there are so many amazing things to do! You can wear fun dresses and get dirty playing outside, or you can stay inside all day and watch television. You can also ride your bike, meet up with friends during any time of the day, or maybe even eat ice-cream for breakfast! I have a birthday during the warmer summer weather and sometimes it is hard to get all my friends together at my home for cake and presents because they are on vacation! When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday. My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together. That's a stinker when that happens. It's a good thing that I have a pig named Joseph to be my friend during those times! I also have other friends, like a cat and a dog, but Joseph is the best. He's a stinker sometimes, but he's got cute little oinks to help me to know what he needs. He's also very sweet, caring, and he's always ready to listen. He's a wonderful friend.

What was David worried about?
David and Lucy waited in their mom's truck. They all were going to the circus to see the clowns. Their Mom had to take their little brother back into the house to get more diapers and go to the bathroom. David was worried because he did not want to miss the wolf clown. Lucy watched her brother rub his chin. "Why are you looking out the window?" she asked. "Mom needs to hurry.  We might miss the clowns." "I am going to get out of the truck and draw triangles in the sand." Lucy said."No! You might make us miss it." David cried. Before she could get out of the truck Lucy saw her mom and little brother walk out of the house. Her mom got in the truck and asked, "Okay kids are we ready to go?"David and Lucy yelled, "Yes!"When they got to the circus David and Lucy saw all the clowns. Their little brother was too young to go into the tent, so their mom stayed with him. The show ended and they walked to the truck. "What do you have there?" David asked Lucy"It is a bag I found in the tent." Lucy said. "We have to return that Lucy." Their mom said. "Why? It has cool stuff in it. I found it." Lucy said. "It is not ours." Their mom said. Lucy frowned as they walked to the lost and found and gave the bag back. Then they all went home. When they were washing up to go to bed Lucy said, "I fear some of those clowns.

Who did the fox get the apple for?
The red fox slowly walked out of his den he lives in; his own house in the ground. His eyes bounced side to side as he made sure the coast was clear, then he ran down the path of autumn leaves. As he reached the end there was a an apple tree without leaves, but still one shiny red colored apple hung from a branch. He climbed up a nearby rock and took a running start towards the branch, jumping and barely grabbing on. He slowly crawled along the branch towards the shiny apple, and as he drew close, he reached out a paw towards the apple. He knocked the apple from the branch and it to the forest floor. The fox slipped and he fell off the branch, but landed safely in a pile of leaves near the apple. He picked up the apple in his mouth and quickly brought it back to his warm den. When he arrived back home, his two fox kits were waiting for him with hungry tummies. Spring, summer, autumn, or winter, it was always warm in the fox den.

How did the teacher react to the naughty boy?
A naughty boy was sitting in math class on Tuesday. There was a broken sink in the back of the room full of water. There was also a kitty on the open window. A loud plane was flying outside and scared the kitty inside. The naughty boy walked up to the kitty and picked it up. What do you think he did next? He threw the kitty into the water in the sink! The kitty didn't last long and ran away from the sink faster than lightning! The other children laughed and laughed, but the teacher didn't think it was funny. She didn't let the naughty boy play on the playground for a week! But the boy didn't care. The class thought he was funny, and so did he. But he would have to get smarter because the sink was fixed soon. The naughty boy thought the teacher was a witch who used a magic kiss to fix it. He had no idea that her husband fixed it the next day.

Who took Tori to Animal Control?
There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was Tori.  Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.  Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.  All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn't know what to do!  The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said "Animal Control".  Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.  Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.  After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.

What was the girl's name?
One morning a girl named Ashely woke up before her Mom and Dad and started watching TV. Once her parents woke up, everybody got dressed to go food shopping for the week. Food shopping was one of Ashley's favorite things to do. The family got to the grocery store and grabbed a shopping cart. The first foods they ran into were the fruits. Ashley ran to pick her favorite fruit, apples, while her parents went and got other things that they needed, like the sour lemons. As the family kept walking through the grocery store Ashley begged for some candy that she saw, but the other things her parents bought were eggs, milk and bread. After all of the food was picked out, the family went up to the check-out line to pay for their food. Ashley never liked the check-out line, as it always took too long, but today was different. The checkout lady, Sarah, was extra nice to her and as she was waiting for her parents to pay, Ashley's father picked out a candy for her to have. It was her favorite, chocolate! Ashley was so excited that she thanked her parents the whole ride home, and even said she would make breakfast. When the family got home that afternoon and the food was in the house, the whole family made their lunch of eggs and toast together.

What happened when John and Sally got into the darkest part of the forest?
One day John and Sally's mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn't have the ingredients. She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need."I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt. I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said."Wow, that sounds horrible," said John."Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally."Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest."I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John. "Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again. If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it."So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home."We're sorry!" they both said to their mother. "We'll never be disobedient again!"And from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.

I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said."Wow, that sounds horrible," said John."Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally."Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest."I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John. "Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again. If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it."So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home."We're sorry!" they both said to their mother. "We'll never be disobedient again!"And from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.

Sometimes he played with blocks.  Sometimes he played with cards.  Sometimes he would even play with his sister's dolls.One day, Andy became bored.  "Maybe I'll play outside," said Andy.  He tried to play outside, but it didn't seem right.  "I know," said Andy, "maybe I'll play in the basement."  So he tried to play in his basement, but that didn't seem right either.  "I guess I can play in my room," said Andy.  So he went to his room to play, but he still felt bored.  "Maybe I need to play with something different," said Andy.

Did the train make noise at all?
Animals love to walk near the train tracks. One night a beautiful black cat was walking along the train tracks looking for a nice mouse to eat. He came across some friends, Bob the cat and Steve the dog. They chose to go looking for food together. They walked up and down the tracks looking for a wonderful meal to snack on, when they happened across a big huge melon. Bob asked the black cat if he like melons, the cat did not like melons. Bob asked the dog if he liked melons, Steve did not like melons either. Bob then ate the melon himself as they looked around for that tasty treat. They heard bells from the train coming by and then they finally saw the food they were looking for jump from the bushes over the tracks and run straight into the barn nearby. The black cat wanted to eat the mouse, so he chased him into the barn. Minutes later the black cat returned with his meal in his mouth to share with his friends.

What color shirt was the man wearing who showed Jane and her dad their seats?
Jane was good at basketball but she liked soccer more.  She played forward for her soccer team on Saturday morning.  A man in a black and white striped shirt blew his whistle to start the game.  It was hot so Jane's coach handed out orange slices for the players to eat at half time.  Jane's team was winning but she was more excited for what she would do in the afternoon.  Her father was going to take her to watch a baseball game.  When the soccer game was over, Jane took off her soccer shoes and put them next to her father's running shoes in the back of his car.  Jane and her father drove to the baseball game.  After buying their tickets, they went to find their seats.  A man in a green shirt stood at the top of the stairs in their section.  He showed them where their seats were.  Jane saw a lot of empty peanut shells on the ground near their seats.  A man in a blue shirt was yelling for people to buy some cotton candy.  Jane's father bought them hot dogs to eat instead.  Jane put ketchup and mustard on hers.  The home team was named the Cardinals and they wore red.  The pitcher threw the first pitch and everyone cheered.

"It's the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. Star!" He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. Star had made out of her own star dust. "It's so cold here in space! A sweater is the best gift ever!"

What is my cat's name?
My cat's name is Buggleton. She is black and white with big green eyes and very long whiskers, like a bug.When I woke up this morning, my cat was not inside the house. She is allowed outside, and we have a cat door in the kitchen so she can come and go as she pleases. She comes home at night, sleeps in her special box, and is here for breakfast before going outside for new adventures. We can lock the cat door so she can't go outside when we go on vacation. If we go on vacation for more than a few days, my mom comes over to check on her and feed her. So it was very weird to wake up and see that she was not home for her morning food! My husband and neighbor and I called for her, but she did not come. Guess where she was? Trapped in the garage overnight!

What is Graham's favorite animal?
When Graham was a little boy, he really like giraffes.  They were his favorite animal to see at the zoo.  He liked giraffes more than elephants, pandas, tigers or lions.  He dreamed of going to Africa to see giraffes in the wild.  He told his family how much he liked them and they made sure he had plenty of books about giraffes.  At school, he often wrote his reports about giraffes.  He even painted his room with spots to look like a giraffe.  When he got older, he went to school to study giraffes and other animals.  Finally, during his final year of school, he went to Africa to study giraffes in their home.  While there he met many people who also liked giraffes.  He liked seeing how tall the giraffes were.  He found that their homes were being destroyed by people using the land.  Graham started an organization which raised money to help buy land for the giraffes to live on.  Graham used everything he knew about giraffes to teach other people.  He gave speeches, wrote books, made signs and sent letters telling people about the giraffes' home being destroyed.

How does the clown work hard?
It was warmer than normal outside at the zoo. The clown was hot in his costume. He still smiled and he still made people laugh. He worked hard. He threw a plane because someone's son asked him to. He even put jelly on his face because a little girl said it would make him look pretty. At noon he juggled plates and at one in the afternoon he sat down to have some lunch. The cook made a salad to his liking and the clown ate it happily. He felt famous because people visiting the zoo pointed at him and smiled at him as he ate his salad. The day might be hot, but the clown felt it was good in the end because of how much people liked him. Soon he was back to work juggling and telling jokes. He even sprayed someone with water when they smelled his fake flower.

Where did Lisa invite Marvin?
Marvin woke up on Monday morning. He yawned and stretched and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. When he got there he brushed his teeth and combed his hair. He went to the kitchen, where he poured some milk into his favorite green bowl and added some cereal. After he finished eating, he went back up to his bedroom to choose his clothes for the day. He put on a red T-shirt and blue jeans, and some funny blue-and-yellow socks. He looked in the mirror and smiled. It was going to be a good day. Marvin thought he would go for a walk. He opened his door and went outside. The sun was shining and he could hear the bluebirds in the trees. Marvin started to whistle a happy song as he made his way down the street. He counted the cars that passed by. Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her. She waved back, and came over. "Hi Marvin," she said. "Do you want to go to the lake today?" Marvin smiled. "Yeah!" he said, "let me go home and get my things." So Marvin turned right around and went back home.

What was the cat confused about?
There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up."What are you doing?!" asked the mouse in surprise. "I am trying to find dinner," said the cat. The mouse smiled. "I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?"The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. "Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK." The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.

What order did Sherry do two of the items on her to-do list?
Sherry went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.  Eventually the laundry was finished washing and drying, so she folded the laundry and put it away.She marked the chores she had completed her to-do list, then it was time for dinner.  First she filled the food bowl of her pet cat, Zoey, then she heated up some leftover lemon-garlic chicken saved from earlier in the week.After dinner she made her bed with fresh sheets from the laundry she did earlier, finished reading her book, put on her pajamas, brushed her teeth, and went to sleep.Overall, it had been a quiet but good day for Sherry, and she fell asleep feeling happy.

Which chore did Sherry do first?
Sherry went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.

How did Rachel know that she could take care of the kitten?
One day Rachel was walking in the park. Suddenly a kitten came up to her and meowed. It reached up and put its feet on Rachel's leg. It was so friendly! But the kitten was very skinny. Its ribs were showing and the sides of its belly were almost touching. It had no collar.Rachel thought that the kitten must not have a home. She brought the kitten home with her. She looked on the Internet to see if it matched a lost kitten ad. But none of the missing kittens looked like her kitten. Rachel took the kitten to the doctor to see if there was an ID chip under the skin. The doctor looked at the kitten with a machine but there was no chip. So Rachel knew this really was a kitten without a home. She knew she would have enough money to pay for the kitten's food and care. She knew she could make enough time to play with the kitten too keep it happy. She paid the doctor to give the kitten its shots. She brought it back home and gave it food and toys. Rachel and the kitten lived happily together for years.

Where did the puppy sleep?
Sally was walking through the park. The bluebirds were singing and the weather was nice. She waved at her neighbor Jerry, who was taking his kitten out. Then she heard a loud noise. The noise was coming from a nearby tree. She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots. It was making a loud, sad noise. Sally bent down and picked up the puppy. It quickly quieted down, and licked her face. Sally laughed. The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw. She couldn't find a tag on him, so she took him home. When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge. The puppy seemed to like it. She also gave him a bowl of water and he lapped it all up. Then the puppy yawned. Sally picked him up and brought him to her bed and put him on her pillow. Sally looked at him with a smile. "I'm going to call you...Jackson." Jackson wagged his tail a little, and fell asleep.

Who did the robin snuggle up with?
There was once a little boy named Jacob, who owned a dog named Pet. One day, Jacob was taking Pet outside to play. He picked up her favorite toy frog. When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.Jacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too. While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.Jacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. "What a peaceful group," she thought. And then she yawned and said, "Now I am feeling sleepy too!"

Natalie's favorite animal was the gorilla.  She loved to watch him jump up and down.  She also liked it when he would pound on his chest and roar.  It was very exciting.  Logan's favorite animal was the giraffe.  He thought that it looked funny.  He also liked its spots.  Tim's favorite animal was the crocodile because it looked tough.  Natalie, Logan, and Tim were not happy with the elephant.  He was their least favorite animal.  All he did was sleep in his cage.  Natalie shouted, "Hey, Mr. Elephant, we want to see you up close!"  The elephant did not wake up.  She yelled a few more times, but the elephant kept sleeping.  She gave up and went to the next animal.  The last animals that they saw were the penguins.

When did the boys get to use the swings?
Bill and Steve went to the park. It was a nice Saturday afternoon. They both rode their bicycles to the park. Bill and Steve were hoping to use the swings, but when they showed up, the swings were being used by Anne and Susan. "Can we use the swings?" Bill asked the two girls, hoping they were almost done."Not now," said Anne. "We have only been here for a little bit." Bill was disappointed, but there were so many other things to do at the park. Bill and Steve went to the slide. Up and down they went, faster and faster, every time! It became a race, Bill and Steve ran back to the ladder as quickly as they could so they could go down again.After a half hour, the two boys were very tired from climbing the ladder and flying down the slide so quickly over and over. They went to their bikes to go back home. As they started going home, they saw Anne and Susan had left. They could use the swings before going home!

What was Kira doing when she was stuck in bed?
It was almost Kira's birthday and Halloween. Kira wanted to paint pumpkins at the circus, but she was sick in bed. She had broken her leg earlier and now all of her leg hurt, even her toes. She had hurried when she had crossed the road, and slipped and ended up going to the hospital. Because she was not being careful enough, she was stuck in bed, eating crackers and watching television. Just as Kira was on her fourth hour of television, her mother knocked on her door. "Kira," she said. "Your friends are here." Kira looked up to see her two best friends, Lexie and Jamie.

Which of the following is not one of the activities the family did at the beach?
The birds chirped, the sun beat down on a nearby window, and the noisy sound of an alarm clock tried to let me know it was seven in the morning. Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing "It's here! It's here Janet, it's here!" That voice belonged to my sister, Karen. What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun! We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in. Karen wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother wouldn't let her. Overall, we had a lot of fun and look forward to the next go around.

A cat was watching a bird in a tree. The blue bird watched the cat as it tried to use its claws and climb up the tree. The cat reached the right branch and slowly walked towards the bird. The bird flew away and the cat was left stuck on the branch. The cat jumped down from the tall branch and didn't get hurt. He then chased after a chipmunk along the ground. The chipmunk was not faster than the cat, but the chipmunk ran up a tree. The cat tried to run up the tree, but fell back down. Not wanting to go back up a tree, the cat watched the chipmunk from the ground. It went into a hole in the tree and the cat gave up. The cat went under a house's deck to keep cool. It watched for more birds or chipmunks that it could chase after. He saw one chipmunk in the distance, then two three and four. He was ready to chase them.

Why did they go to the park?
Once there was a white horse named Bob, who lived in a house with his best friend. His friend was a cat named Shelly who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with Lucy a lamb who lived next door. It was Friday morning and Bob and Shelly were in the park waiting for Lucy. She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball. "What can we use for a ball?" Bob asked. They looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing. "Let's use a melon," Bob said."That's stupid," said Shelly, the practical one."No hear him out," said Lucy. "It might work."It'll work," said Bob, and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly. "You pitch.""This is going to end badly, I'm afraid," Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate."I know what I'm doing," Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby. "Oops," said Bob.

Why were there so many people in the store?
There were many people at the store that day. This was because it was Saturday. It was even more full of people around noon when Mary and her mother went out to go shopping. In the store, Mary wanted her mother to buy her candy but Mary's mother was in a hurry. She did not have time for that. That is because she wanted to get home before it started to rain. Mary crossed her arms when her mother said no. Mary was sad that her mother would not get her any candy. But at home, her mother had a surprise for her. She told Mary to close her eyes. She thought it might be a toy. When she opened them again, she saw that her mother had baked her something. Her mother opened the oven. Inside was a cake. She jumped up in excitement. She didn't need to think how she felt. She was very happy. She did not want the candy now. She immediately took a big slice. She wasn't sure it she would eat it now. Then she ate it before she could make up her mind! Her smile then left her mouth. She quickly she became sad. Her mother had told her it was bedtime.

What was Bob's fourth class of the day?
Bob woke up to go to his first day of school on Monday. He woke up to his dog barking at him. His parents gave him a ride to school. When he arrived at school, he went to his first class which was gym class. In gym class, his gym teacher made him run laps around the track because he had been late to class. After he had ran his laps, he played baseball with his friends. Bob had wanted to play kickball or basketball, but his friends had chosen to play baseball. After gym class was over, he went to English class. In English class, he read a story about a lady who had fallen in love with a kitty. One day the kitty jumped out of the window in the lady's house and never came back. The lady was sad and wondered why her kitty would leave her. Bob was very moved by the story. After English class was over, he went to his third class of the day which was math. Bob kept quiet in his math class because he didn't know the answers to most of the questions the teacher was asking. After his math class, he went to the fourth and last class of the day which was arts and crafts. In arts and crafts, Bob painted a picture that he was very proud of. When art class was over, Bob was happy because he had finished his first day of school. He was excited to go to school on Tuesday and Wednesday.

What type of pet did the boy want?
Once, there was a boy named Dan that was no older then seven or eight years old.  Dan lived with his mother Sam and father Spike in a small house in a dangerous neighborhood in New York city.  Before their move from Florida he spent most of his time outside at a park. In fact they moved around a lot.  They have also lived in Georgia and California and this was the first time being stuck inside. It got so bad he was looking forward to going to school. This boy was an only child and was not allowed to go outside to play.  Instead he spent most of his time locked inside his house alone with no friends to play with.  One day he got a great idea.  Why don't I ask my mom, for a pet?  He thought long and hard.  I can get a dog or cat. I don't like birds, fish or hamsters. This way I'll always have a friend to play with when I'm inside.  He thinks to run up to his mom and say mommy, mommy!  Can I get a new pet?  His mom told him that if he wanted a pet that he would have to show her that he could take care of it.  She gave him chores and said, "if you can do these chores for one month I'll get you a dog."  Every evening before bed he would clear the table, clean the bathrooms and nicely stack all of the dishes.  His mother was in awe in the fact the she never had to tell him to complete his chore.  At the end of the month his mother kept her promise a got him a new puppy.  The boy was in love at first sight but the boy wasn't sure if the puppy looked like a Bob or a Rick.  Finally he yelled,  "I'm going to call him Rick!"

Why did Martin and Mark sit near Matt?
I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!

How long did he fish?
A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat. He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook. He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time. After three hours there was still not a bite. The sun moved slowly across the sky. Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening. It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up. A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours. It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly. The fisherman went home empty handed. He went home to his log cabin and sat by the fire. His stomach growled because there wasn't any dinner to eat tonight, but tomorrow would be a better day.

Why did the doctor write a lot of notes down?
One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her. The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day. The nurse also took his temperature to make sure that he did not have a fever. After the nurse left the room, the doctor came in and asked Sam about his knee. Sam told the doctor all about his fall off the tricycle and the doctor wrote a lot of notes down. Doctors write a lot of notes so they can tell people like Sam more about their accidents. The doctor said, "Wow Sam! It sounds like you had quite a fall." The doctor put a bandage on his knee and gave him some medicine to take once he got home. On the way out of the doctor's office, Sam took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home. Sam's mom drove him back home, telling him to be careful for the next time that he plays outside. Sam's mom really cared about him and didn't like to see him get hurt.

What did Curtis want to be someday?
Dr. CurtisOn a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm.Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn't wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. "Bonnie is going to be alright," he said to Curtis."Really?" the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, "I got to go check on her." "That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn.

Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn.

What was built on the tree?
There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play.  The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.

What item did Jane like the most?
Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch. She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before Jane even got close. But that didn't stop Jane from barking at them whenever she saw them. Jane liked being active. Even when Jane was all alone, she was active. Jane was a happy dog.

Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn't want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn't true, but Tom didn't want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special.

Sometimes Tiger got into fights with his brother Tom and Tabby always took Tiger's side. One time Tiger accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. Tabby was very mad and Tiger blamed it on Tom. Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn't want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn't true, but Tom didn't want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special. When Tabby and Tom came home Leon left and Tom went to live with him. They went to the ocean together; the mountains, the forest and Leon even took Tom to the moon. Tom was happy, because he got to see things that Tiger never got to see. They lived happily ever after.

Why was Jim's boot frozen?
Jim rode his bike quickly.  It was Friday and he wanted to get to the lake.  The path to the lake was long and winding.  It was wetter on Tuesday.  Jim had to wash his boot.  His boot had once been frozen.  It was frozen because he left it outside on Sunday.   He had to leave his boot outside for a long time.  The lake was facing the tree.  Jim had to go home.  He wanted food very badly.  Jim went home.  He got inside and looked up at the ceiling.  He walked to the refrigerator.  Jim took the yogurt out of the refrigerator.  Some milk was on the table and he grabbed a cup so he could pour himself some of the milk.  Jim also had a candy bar.  Jim sat down and rested.  He was tired from the long bike ride.  He finished his yogurt and began planning his next trip to the lake.  It would not be long before he returned.  He and his boots were ready for more fun outdoors Monday.

Who was Isaac?
There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn't look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in. Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.

What food did Allie carry with her as part of her costume?
Allie was trying to choose which costume she would wear for Halloween.  She did not want to dress up as a scary monster.  She could go as an angel all in white or as a rabbit with a basket of eggs.  She thought that wings would be too hard to make.  Allie went to ask her mom if she had any eggs to go in her basket.  Her mom said that the eggs might break and told her to use carrots instead.  Allie looked in the refrigerator but there were no carrots.  She took some spinach instead.   Allie got an old pillow case out of the hall closet.  She would use it to carry the candy she would get.  Allie's little sister, Grace, was going as a princess dressed in pink.  She had a shiny, silver purse on her arm.  Allie took Grace by the hand and led her down the sidewalk.  The first door they knocked on was answered by a woman dressed as witch with a tall, black hat on her head.  The witch gave both of the girls some candied apples.

What costume did Allie choose?
Allie was trying to choose which costume she would wear for Halloween.  She did not want to dress up as a scary monster.  She could go as an angel all in white or as a rabbit with a basket of eggs.  She thought that wings would be too hard to make.  Allie went to ask her mom if she had any eggs to go in her basket.  Her mom said that the eggs might break and told her to use carrots instead.

What color was the van and the tree house
In their small town there are not very many kids. Joe is 8 years old. Nate is 9 years old. They have been the only two boys since they were born. One day Joe saw a White moving truck down the street from his and Nate's tree house. Joe got really excited and told Nate about it. Nate and Joe waited, hoping to see another boy that could join their club.  The Boy's Club started when they were 6 and their dads helped them build their tree house and paint it dark blue.  Joe and Nate both wanted more friends so they could play team games like baseball and football. Nate started day dreaming about playing baseball. Joe started thinking about how fun football would be. They don't like playing board games, Go Fish or Old Maid any more. They were both looking out the window of the tree house, waiting for the family to get out of the dark blue van that pulled up next to the moving truck. The sun's bright yellow light made it hard for the boys to see as the van door opened Nate looked close and yelled out "There are three boys"!  Both boys got really excited and started walking down the street toward the new family. Nate broke into a run and brown dust started coming up from the ground behind his feet. Joe started running to catch up to Nate. They made it to the house quickly and one of the new boys gave a strange look as Nate and Joe both held their knees trying to catch their breath.  A few seconds later Nate stood up and said, "Hi I'm Nate and this is Joe. Do you want to join The Boy's Club"? The boy said, "Sure. Can my brothers be in the club too? And Joe said, "YES!" The boy took a step back and said, "Well, I'm Jacob and my twin's name is Josh. We are 9 and our little brother is Alex. He's 7." Nate and Joe started planning games and made friends quickly with the new boys.

What did she read about in the magazine?
Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat, but she didn't know if she could do it.  Once, when she was younger, she had tried to go without eating meat, but before the first day was over, her stomach had felt a little empty.  "Hmm," she had thought.  "Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat.  Maybe that's why I feel so hungry."But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.  Below the title, the cover said, "Learn to live on vegetables!"  She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly.  If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could, but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy.  That way, she would feel better, instead of feeling so hungry!Millie wasn't sure if it would work this time, but the magazine's tips made her want to give it another try!

Why did the driver put the toothpaste back?
There once was a clown named Happy who traveled with the circus.  He was one of the most famous clowns of all time, because he was once the star of a movie.  Happy did a lot of things in his act that were very silly.  He was best known for belting out songs in the wrong key, which would make neighborhood cats meow and howl. Happy would do other funny things in his act, like wrestle a big plastic alligator with tape over its mouth.  He would also throw buckets of water at the people watching the circus, wetting all the people in the front seats. One day, a driver in the circus needed to brush his teeth because he had been eating popcorn all day. He was out of toothpaste, so he went to ask Happy if he could borrow some.  Happy was eating a brownie, and his mouth was very full.  When he tried to talk, he sounded sillier than ever.  The driver laughed and asked Happy to point to the toothpaste.

What was Happy eating?
There once was a clown named Happy who traveled with the circus.  He was one of the most famous clowns of all time, because he was once the star of a movie.  Happy did a lot of things in his act that were very silly.  He was best known for belting out songs in the wrong key, which would make neighborhood cats meow and howl. Happy would do other funny things in his act, like wrestle a big plastic alligator with tape over its mouth.  He would also throw buckets of water at the people watching the circus, wetting all the people in the front seats. One day, a driver in the circus needed to brush his teeth because he had been eating popcorn all day. He was out of toothpaste, so he went to ask Happy if he could borrow some.  Happy was eating a brownie, and his mouth was very full.  When he tried to talk, he sounded sillier than ever.  The driver laughed and asked Happy to point to the toothpaste.

What was the main boy's name in the story?
Amy and David had been best friends since Kindergarten. They had become friends on the very first day, since both of them loved airplanes. David had made a paper plane for his friend Pete, but he let Amy play with it as much as she wanted. He ended up giving it to her and making a new one for Pete, and another for himself. To thank him, she made him a paper heart. When it was recess, they went outside and flew their planes high into the air. They laughed when David's plane landed on the teacher's head. She laughed too and gave David back his plane.Now that they are older, Amy and David are learning more about planes and flying. Neither of them had ever been in a real airplane, but they watched them in movies and wanted to fly in one. Amy's mother knew about their dreams and set up a small trip for them across the state. As they were riding in the car, the kids could not contain their excitement. They talked all about what it would be like to finally fly in the sky and wondered about the things they would see. Amy's mother gave them a book about airplanes to read during the trip.When they got on the plane, Amy became afraid. Her mother calmed her down and gave her a new doll to hold to help her feel safe. When the plane took off, Amy and David both shouted with happiness and watched out the windows. They watched the ground get smaller and smaller and finally disappear. They sat back in their seats, ready to enjoy the ride.

Georgia was far from Thomas's house, so he had to take a train.  He bought a ticket for the train ride.  The ticket was five dollars.  Before he got on the train, Thomas the spider packed his bag.  He packed his blanket, two shirts, and two pairs of pants.  He did not pack any books or toys.  His grandmother had toys for him to play with.  She also had books for him to read.  Thomas likes to read and play with toys.  Thomas used the phone to call his grandmother to tell her he was coming to visit.  She was very excited.  Thomas took his bag and went to the train.  At the train Thomas looked at the snacks.  He wanted vanilla pudding.  They did not have vanilla or chocolate, so Thomas got strawberry.  He took his bag and strawberry pudding and got on the train.

What day of the week did Harry escape?
Harry was a good hamster. He would run on the wheel in his cage every day. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and on the weekends, his master would even put him a plastic ball that allowed him to run all across the house, as long as he stayed in the ball. Harry loved the plastic ball, and he even liked his master, but Harry wanted to see the outside of the orange house he had lived in for as long as he could remember. He wanted to feel the rain on his fur, wanted to eat wild seeds that fell from the tree. He wanted to be free! He would watch the flowers come up in the spring from his window, and the snow fall in the winters, always wanting to know what the seasons felt like. \tabOne Tuesday morning in the summer, Harry woke up to the sun shining down into his cage in the middle of the room that he stayed in. "Today is the day I see the world!" Harry yelled to himself. He waited for his master to put him in his plastic ball. He thought as long as he could make it to the door, he would be free. His master soon came into the room, slowly picked Harry out of the cage, put Harry inside his ball, and closed the lid. Just to put on a show, Harry walked around the room in his ball until his master had left. As soon as his master shut the door, Harry took off towards the outside! He ran towards the door, slipped through the doggy door, and rolled himself outside. He was free! He could see the large trees, and the high grass. Harry looked around, and knew he had found his place in the world.

What day did I buy my mom flowers?
On Mother's Day Sunday I went to breakfast with my mom, sister and wife. The day before that, I bought my mom a lovely bunch of flowers. My mom had eggs, my sister had pancakes, and my wife had toast. I had a muffin. The restaurant was called Maggie's. It was not my favorite breakfast restaurant. I like Denny's or a diner. Breakfast was not good. The pancakes were soggy, the toast was burned and the eggs were cold. Even worse, my breakfast made me sick. But after breakfast we went back to my house and I gave my mom the present I bought. It was a sunny day, and we all had a nice afternoon.

Why did Bob go to the store?
Today Bob was hungry. He had some pancakes in his fridge but did not feel like eating pancakes today. He thought to himself, "I want to get some food from the store." So he went to the store and bought a sandwich. When he was at the store there was a picture of a brown cat on the wall. Under that picture was a box full of candy. Bob knew that he did not want to eat too much candy, but he wanted to get some candy anyway. He went to the box of candy and put some in his shopping bag so he could buy it. Bob went to the front and paid for all of his food. After buying his food, he went home and ate it. The sandwich was delicious and after he ate the sandwich he ate the candy too.

What food was NOT at the bake sale?
The second grade students at Valley Elementary School were going to put on a bake sale. They wanted to raise enough money to take a field trip to the zoo. They invited all of the other students and teachers. They also invited the principal and their parents to come! They were going to have the bake sale on Friday afternoon. Today was Monday, so they only had four days to get everything together! First, Miss Walter, the principal, bought the tables and chairs for the bake sale. Next, Miss Holly, the second grade teacher, bought plates and forks and spoons. But Miss Holly forgot to buy the napkins! One of the other second grade teachers ended up buying napkins along with cups for milk and juice. On Friday, all of the students brought in their baked goods and drinks. Nancy brought chocolate chip cookies. Alex brought brownies. Jose brought vanilla cupcakes. Patty brought lemonade and apple juice. The bake sale raised enough money for two field trips!

Who does not play soccer?
The kitchen comes alive at night in the Sanderson house. Vegetables, fruit, bread, and more come out to play. The knives and forks dance on the tables. There are games and prizes. Milk is used for swimming races. The cereal often wins those. Fruit gets used as balls in some games. Blueberries scream in joy as they are kicked into soccer goals in games between the spoons and vegetables like celery and carrots. Their cousins, the raspberries, like to watch the games. Everyone has a great time and laughs. They are happy to come out and be friends. If someone, like little John or his sister Kim, comes down to get water, they all hide until they leave. The father, Ryan, sometimes wakes up and thinks he hears something downstairs. His wife, Susan, tells him he needs to go back to bed. She tells him he is imagining things. He is not.

What was the name of the elf?
Once upon a time there was a little elf named Boo.  Boo longed for a goldfish more than anything in the world, so he begged and begged his parents for one.  Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself. With that, Boo set out to look for a goldfish.  First he looked under his pillow.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the fridge.  No goldfish their either.  Frustrated, he went to his friend Miles.  Miles was an alligator.  Boo asked Miles, "Miles, where could I find a goldfish?"Miles thought long and hard.  Then he thought some more.  He thought even more after that.  At long last, Miles spoke.  "I have an idea," he said, "but you must do a few things for me first.  First you must clap for me."Boo clapped many times.  "Now," spoke Miles, "You must chirp like a young bird."  Boo chirped happily.  "Last," said Miles, "You must fold my laundry.  It is behind the wood pile."  Boo quickly set to work folding the laundry.  When he was all done he returned to Miles."Miles," he asked, "Where can I find a goldfish?"Miles smiled as he spoke, "Fish swim, yes?  Look in a place with water."Boo quickly returned home and began his hunt.  First he looked in his drink cup.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the toilet.  What he saw in the toilet surprised him.  There was a goldfish swimming in the toilet!  As it turned out, it was a very special goldfish.  The fish was a funny color.  It wasn't red.  It wasn't orange.  It wasn't green.  It was blue!  Boo named his goldfish Apple Cracker and they quickly became friends.

When was the first and second time the bunny came back?
Randan's parents surprised her one day by bring home a small bunny. This was the first pet she had, so she started to shout and scream happily right when she saw it. After having keeping it in a cage in the house for a couple hours, she tried to take it outside to play. That was when everything went wrong. After she stepped outside, the cage fell and her thumb accidentally opened the cage, and the bunny ran away. Randan got very sad, but the bunny sounded like it was singing as it ran off. Later that night, Randan was still sad about the bunny as she was lying on her bed. All of a sudden, she heard a loud bang so everybody ran outside. They found the trash can tipped over and a lot of the food ate from it. Her dad wondered who did it, and Randan wondered if it was the bunny that ran away. She said to herself that it could not have done it. The bunny was way too small to even shake a trashcan.Nothing special happened for the rest of the week, until they heard a strange noise on another night. This time, only Randan and her Dad went outside to check out what the noise was. When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep. Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house. They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry. The dad quickly gave Randan a magical glove that makes her grip one million times stronger. The dad got some glue and made the bunny's butt stuck on the carpet. Randan grabbed the bunny by the leg and threw it to space.

Why did Tarwala poop on the mat?
Tarwala was a strange boy. He liked to eat anything that was put in front of him, even if it wasn't food. As a child he ate chalk sticks thinking it was candy. All the strange things he ate made him very sick. After eating the chalk, his stomach made a weird noise as if it was trying to talk to him. Tarwala accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things. One day, Tarwala got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats. His parents felt that they needed to help Tarwala fix his problem. His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it. One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of Tarwala. Tarwala immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened. Tarwala saw bright lights and passed out. It turns out that Tarwala's dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month. The stink was so powerful that it got magical. The magical stink changed Tarwala's mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food. Tarwala started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.

What kinds of animals did the bear follow?
There was once a young bear who lived in a small cave in the woods. His cave was comfy, warm, and dark, and had a bit of a yard in front of it. The bear lived with his mother and father, and spent his days walking around and his nights curled up asleep. He liked to look for berries to eat. His favorite berries were blueberries, but he would eat any berries he found: strawberries, raspberries, cherries, anything.There was a river near the bear's cave, and he loved to sit on the bank and look at the fish and frogs, and at his own reflection in the water. One sunny afternoon, when he was looking into the river, he saw a family of ducks swimming by. He got up and followed them. They swam along in the river, and he walked along the bank. They traveled like this until they reached a small clearing in the forest. The bear stopped and looked around, and saw that the clearing was completely filled with blueberries -- more than he had ever seen! The young bear ate his fill of blueberries, then took home as many as he could carry in his paws. He went to bed happy. It was a wonderful day.

What was the bear like after the summer?
The big white bear walked over the ice.  After he went a few feet, he pushed his paws down on the ice as hard as he could.  The sheet of ice cracked, and the big bear learned that he still had to wait.The big white bear was waiting to go out to the ice and hunt.  He was getting thin after a long summer in the far north, and he was ready to catch a seal.  In a few weeks, he could walk out on the ice, far from shore.

Leah was laughing and happy.Suddenly a big, yellow dog walked into the park.  This was really a friendly dog, and only wanted someone to play with.  But Leah was scared of dogs.Leah didn't see the dog at first.  Leah started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed Leah.  Before Leah sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her.  The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open.Leah was scared.  She started yelling and screaming.  This only made the dog look confused.  The dog then began sounding out with Leah, barking and howling itself.  They were a sight to see with Leah screaming and the dog howling.Mommy went over and took Leah away from the dog, but mommy could barely keep herself from laughing.

Why was Susie sad?
Susie really wanted to get a pet. She really liked animals, and her parents said she was ready. What kind of pet did she want? She wanted a pet that wasn't too loud. She didn't want it to wake her up early! She wanted a pet that wasn't too calm. She wanted it to make her laugh! She wanted a pet that was a pretty color. She wanted to show her pet to all her friends! She asked everyone what kind of pet she could get. "Get a pig," said her teacher, Ms. Hammerstein. "Pigs are pink, and pink is a good color." Susie went to the pet store to get a pig. "Oink!" said the pig. "Oink oink oink!" It was very loud. Susie did not like the pig at all. "Get a cat," said her sister, May. "Cats are funny." Susie went to the pet store to get a cat. "Meow!" said the cat. It wasn't too loud, but it was a boring grey. That wasn't a pretty color at all! "Get a turtle," said her brother, George. "Turtles are a pretty green and they aren't very loud." Susie went to the pet store to get a turtle. It didn't say anything, because turtles don't say much. It didn't do anything either. It was too boring for Susie. "Oh no!" said Susie. She was very sad. "There are no good pets for me!" She was about to give up when she saw a bowl on a table. It had water and a little fish in it. The fish was a pretty orange color. It swam in circles all around its bowl. It didn't say anything. It was perfect! "I want the fish!" Susie said, and she bought a new goldfish. She named him Steve, and they were very happy together.

What was Bob doing in class?
Bob and Sue were in class.  Bob was listening to the teacher.  Sue was looking out the window, thinking about what she would do during recess.  The teacher was writing on the chalkboard as she spoke.  She was very happy to be teaching the children more vocabulary words to use.  Then they could read more books.  The teacher thought reading was always a very fun activity. While thinking, Sue planned how she would climb the tall tree in the playground.  It had many low, thick branches.  She wanted to see what the yard looked like from up above.  She did not think reading was a very fun activity at all.  She would rather be outside. Bob took lots of notes on what the teacher was saying.  He also copied down everything she wrote.  He was very proud of his notes.  If the other students ever needed help, he was glad give it to them. He thought reading the books people his age told him to read boring.  However, he loved borrowing books from his older sister.  Those books were exciting to him.  He wanted to learn more vocabulary so he could better understand the stories in his older sister's books. Soon enough, the bell rang.

Which of these did Lana not have for breakfast?
A lamb named Lana woke up on an early Monday morning. After taking a shower and getting dressed, she chose to start making something to eat. In the end, she made eggs, toast and coffee for her breakfast. While she was eating, she was called on the telephone by her good friend Drake the dog. They chose to meet up after Lana finished eating so they could take a walk around the park. Drake also told her that their friend, Terry the turtle, would not be joining them. As soon as Lana finished cleaning her dishes, she heard a knock on her door - it was Drake! She threw on her coat and went outside, so they could start their walk. In the end, they spent a few hours walking along the park's sidewalk, until ending up back near Lana's house. "Let's do this again soon!" Drake said, as he wagged his tail. "Sure!" Lana said, as she walked back into her home. Lana made a light dinner, cleaned up, then chose to hop into bed. She soon fell asleep.

Did the group win the game?
I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.

Which team won the football game?
Once there was a turkey named Tim, who enjoyed playing house, playing football and riding his bicycle all the time. His favorite food would be corn, which he enjoys licking when it is still on the cob. But his parents spank him to try to get him to stop doing that, as he often burns his tongue when the cob is too hot. He enjoys watching football games as well, he always cheers and claps for his favorite team, the Gobblers. In a game he watched last week, the other team, a chicken team named the Clucks, were playing as well. It was a close game, but the Gobblers ended up winning with a little luck. Tim's best friend was also watching the game, Tony the lizard, and they both enjoyed watching the game together!

Who wore a cap?
Billy and his friend Jake were walking together to meet their friends Kevin and Gordon at the park. They sometimes played in each Jake's backyard, but there was much more room at the park. And it was far too dangerous to play in the street. They were going to play touch football. They would sometimes played baseball and soccer, and even kickball but today the weather was perfect for football. The summer breeze almost blew Billy's cap off. Billy loved summertime. He liked the fall, too, when the leaves started to turn pretty colors. But he hated winter. Billy didn't like the snow. Spring was also nice. Jake was drinking a Pepsi, and Billy had a bottle of water. Gordon and Kevin would most likely be drinking blue or red Gatorade at the park where they waited.

Why did John lick the worm?
There once was a boy named John who was a good superhero. He thought he was a superhero, at least. His mommy made him eat his cereal with yoghurt every morning so he could stay strong.

John thought she was an evil superhero at least. When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. John closed his eyes and licked it. Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere. First thing tomorrow, John would start wearing a cape to school. He hoped his mommy would let him wear it. The bus came and Ashley was still sitting on the ground laughing. John had a great, superhero kind of thought. He put the worm in her hair.

What does Billy find under the rock?
One morning, Billy was giving some milk to his lamb, Beverly. He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock. He went to see what was making the sound, and Beverly followed him. He looked around the rock, but couldn't see anything. Billy tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy. "I wonder what's making that noise," Billy said. Beverly ate some grass. He went back home. Beverly followed him.Billy asked his wife, Judy, if she had anything that could lift the rock. She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel. "Use the spoon to dig under the rock," she said. "Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you.""That's a good idea," Billy said. He dug under the rock with the spoon. Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.Then Beverly, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead. At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole. Then, when Billy pulled and Beverly pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill."Thank you, Beverly," Billy said. "I couldn't have done it without you."Billy and Beverly looked where the rock had been. In the middle of the circle of dirt, they saw a little cave with some baby bunnies in it. The bunnies looked hungry, and were crying for food. Billy went back home and told Judy, and she gave the bunnies some lettuce.

The kid was going for a quick swim. He loved to get out and hop back into the water. When he was out of the pool he liked to dance and run around. Sometimes when he got out he would sit in the chair and get some sun. He liked to work on his skin color. Just like his mommy. He would take his toys and hop in the water with them. He liked to play football in the water the most. He was taller than the other kids his age, so he could play football and not worry about the bigger kids. He could jump into the deeper section of the pool as long as he got back to where he could touch before his mom worried too much. The pool was his favorite place in the world. The boy could imagine he was doing anything. All of his problems went away. It was a very nice place for him to get his energy out and make friends for when he wasn't at the pool. He loved making friends.

What did Sally make today?
Sally wants to learn how to cook. She has only made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before.  Today she is going to try to make some spaghetti with meat sauce.  First she goes to the store down the street to buy the food. She buys six tomatoes, some beef, seasoning, one box of pasta and ten pieces of fruit.  When she gets home she goes to the kitchen and starts boiling some water. The water takes four hundred seconds to boil.  Next, she cuts up the beef and puts it in a pan to fry it. When the beef is cooked she starts to cut the tomatoes. When she is finished with the tomatoes she puts them in the pan and puts a lid on top. Once the tomatoes get hot she adds the seasoning and mixes the sauce.  Finally she adds the cooked pasta to the sauce. Sally thinks that her spaghetti with meat sauce smells really good! She takes some to the table and starts eating her dinner. Her table is in the dining room. Sally wants to cook more foods tomorrow, maybe she'll make some fried rice!

What item was not wished for in the story?
A boy named Pedro was walking down the street one day, and he met a pretty girl in a pink dress who handed him a bell. It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy. Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner. It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder. Alice thought the bell was a wonderful thing, and chose to keep it, rather than give it away. The next day when she woke up, her bird had flown away.

How many friends did Leah see riding their bikes?
Leah rides her bikeLeah was excited.  Today was her seventh birthday and she picking out her present.  It was a new pink bike with a basket and bell.  It was much prettier than her old red and white bike.  The bell on her old bike didn't ring, and the basket on that bike was torn.The only problem was that Leah could not ride a bike yet.  Her old bike had training wheels, but her new one did not.  Leah wanted to ride her bike, but she was scared.  Daddy told her, "Leah, everyone is scared at first, but once you try, you are going to learn and stop being scared."Leah watched her friends riding their bikes.  First Owen rode by the house and back up the street.  Then along rode Dulce and Ruby.  Leah was sad.  She wished she could go riding with them.Leah finally chose to learn to ride her bike.  She put on a helmet, elbow pads and knee pads.  She was ready for battle!Mommy and Daddy went out with Leah and watched her start to pedal down the street.  After a small bit, the bike tipped over.  She sat on the road looking sad.   She looked so cute sitting there that Daddy wanted laugh, but instead said, "Leah, you can do it.  Go again."Leah tried several more times, and soon was riding!   She went down the street and back again.  Here came her friends with their bikes.  Leah shouted, "wait for me," and joined them riding down the street.

What does the hamster want to eat his lunch with?
The room had a high ceiling and white walls. The lunch was in the center of the room on a stand. The hamster was the first to see the lunch and ran over to it. "What a delicious lunch," he said, "I wish there was something for me to eat it with!"The hamster heard a noise in the corner and jumped up to look and see what it was. It was piggy. "Why do you need something to eat it with?" Piggy asked, "I roll around in my food and that works out well for me.""I was taught better manners than that," said the hamster, "I would at least like to find a fork to eat with." "I've heard they have forks in the farmhouse," said Piggy. "The farmers and their kids eat with them all the time. If you want, you can climb on my back and we can make a trip to the farmhouse together."The hamster and Piggy set off on their trip.

What was the queen's favorite flavor?
Once there was a beautiful Queen.  She liked dancing.  She liked singing.  She liked playing.  But the thing she liked the most was eating ice cream.  She liked many kinds of ice cream, but her favorite was strawberry.  She liked it best because it was pink, and pink was her favorite color.  Because she liked eating ice cream so much, she wanted a kingdom wide ice cream eating holiday.  Everyone had to stop working and eat ice cream.  All of the people were happy with the new holiday.  It was summer, and everyone would rather eat ice cream than work.  The queen wanted to see what the favorite flavor of ice cream was in her kingdom.  Everyone got to say their favorite flavor.  159 people liked chocolate.  67 people liked vanilla.  382 people liked strawberry.  The queen was very happy that everyone liked strawberry as much as she did.  The king was not happy.  He liked chocolate the best.  He wanted to get rid of all of the strawberry ice cream so that chocolate could be the winner.  When the queen found out she was very sad.  Then she had an idea: chocolate strawberry ice cream.  The king liked the idea.  All the people liked the idea.  A new ice cream flavor was made and everyone loved it.

My name is Sandra. Let me tell you the story of the best meal I ever had.I was sitting on the school bench outside Springfield Elementary School, waiting to pick up my granddaughter. She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades. To pass the time, I played my triangle. In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large New York band, the Black Triangles. We all wore full black costumes every time we played."What lovely triangle music! You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time." A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!  She was holding a trumpet. It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and Black Triangle trumpet player Matilda.

What did Ryan send to him that Mom sewed on his jacket?
My brother Ryan is 12 years older than me. He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned 7 one summer, he left home to join the Army. He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn't see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I can't wait to see him again. Next time, we'll visit him on vacation. I want to see the Army trucks and helicopters.

He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I can't wait to see him again. Next time, we'll visit him on vacation. I want to see the Army trucks and helicopters.

When Ryan was in the Army, how could they see his face when they missed him?
My brother Ryan is 12 years older than me. He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned 7 one summer, he left home to join the Army. He thought about joining the Marines, the Air-Force, or the Navy, but he liked the Army better. He was away for a long time. I didn't see him again until I was almost 8! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that Mom sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room.

Where did Manny hop to after his feelings were hurt?
In a big forest lived a fox named Manny. He was having a fun morning. Dad had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy! Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. Manny spoke first. "Hi there, my name is Manny and I'm a fox. Who are you?" The frog on the log didn't answer at first. He finally said, "My name is Tony and I'm a frog. My brother could beat you up." Manny was very surprised to hear this. First, why would a frog's brother want to fight him? Second, how could some little frog beat him up? Manny told Tony he didn't think he would want to fight his brother because he would hurt him. Tony jumped off the log and hopped away, shouting over his shoulder, "You're a liar! My brother can beat up anyone!" As the frog went away, Manny was very confused. He didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the frog was sad because of what Manny said. Manny also did not like to be called a liar, so he ran after the frog. He soon found out that Tony's brother was not from the same mother. His brother was a brown bear named Greg. After taking a good look at Greg, Manny said yes, Greg could beat up anyone he chose. After that day all three of them became close friends.

What flavor was the birthday cake?
Annie's sister, Julia, was having a birthday party in the afternoon.  Annie's mother was going to bake the cake for the party.  Mother asked Annie to help her bake the cake.  They chose to make a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  Annie got the bowls and the ingredients they would need for the cake.  She helped measure the flour, the sugar and the cocoa.  Once her mother added the rest of the ingredients, Annie was allowed to stir the ingredients in the bowl.  She helped to pour the cake mix into two pans and then put them in the oven.  The smell of the cake made Annie hungry.  While the cake was baking, Annie helped her mother make the chocolate frosting.  Her mother let her lick the spoon when they were done mixing the frosting.  Once the cake was done, Annie and her mother took the cake out of the oven and let it cool, and then they frosted it.  They ate the chocolate cake at Julia's party with scoops of vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries.  Annie gave their dog, Sunny, a little piece of cake too!

The name of the horse was what?
It was a boring day out on the range for cowboy Bob. He was riding around on his horse. It was a good animal, and its name was Steve. Steve was an old friend to Bob. He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. Bob's job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy Bob. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day. Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm. Bob also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote. Bob and Steve were happy having each other as friends.

It was a boring day out on the range for cowboy Bob. He was riding around on his horse. It was a good animal, and its name was Steve. Steve was an old friend to Bob. He had been carrying Bob around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. Bob's job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy Bob. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse Steve to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day. Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm. Bob also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote. Bob and Steve were happy having each other as friends.

Why does Robert come to West Texas?
Oil is plentiful in West Texas. When people think of West Texas they think of these machines called "pump-jacks." A pump-jack is a machine that pulls Oil out of the Earth. Robert's job is to fix pump-jacks. So he travels to West Texas to see if he can help. Steve owns many pump-jacks and is having a very tough time keeping them working. During the summer in West Texas the temperature can be over 100, which causes these machines to break often. Robert runs into Steve at a restaurant on a very hot day. After they talked about the weather for a few seconds, Steve says "my machines keep breaking because of this heat!" Robert says "Steve, I think you and I are both in luck because I fix pump-jacks." Immediately, they both travel out to Steve's land and Robert gets to work!

Who was Jane with at the pool?
Jane went with her family swimming to the pool. Jane and her brother, Mark, get along really well and they always have so much fun at the pool together. This time, there was a huge storm coming. As they were swimming, the life guard told everyone to get out of the pool. The life guard also warned everyone of the storm. Jane and Mark got out of the pool as fast as they could and went to a safe place and waited until the storm was over. Jane started to get worried as the storm got worse and worse. Mark told her not to worry because he didn't think the storm was very bad and that he thought it was almost over. As he told her about the storm, a man walked by and told them that the storm was almost over and that they could go back and swim in a little bit. Jane was very happy to hear that she can go back to having fun in the pool with her brother.

What was Michelle's idea?
June and Michelle were playing outside in their yard on a winter day. Michelle was making pies and cakes out of mud. June was writing her ABCs in the sand with a button she found. June's mom told the girls they were going to the store soon and not to get dirty. Michelle knew she would get in trouble but she kept playing in the dirt because she liked pretending to cook. Her mom cooked and Michelle wanted to be grown-up like her mom. June looked down at her blue jeans and saw the dirt. "Oh No!" she said to Michelle. Michelle looked down at the mud on her shoes and shirt. She smiled, "Mommy says cooking is messy business!" "What are we going to do? Mom is going to be so mad!" June worried. "We can tell her we were thinking as we played, she always says school is not only a place." Michelle said. "That won't work!" June cried. "Wait! I have an idea." Michelle said as she wiped her hands on the back of her blue jeans. Michelle walked over to June's fence and pulled out the prettiest prized purple flowers from the bush. June looked at her friend more worried. Michelle walked past June and knocked on the door with the purple flowers in her hand and a big smile on her face. Mrs. Jones answered the door looking mad. Before she could say anything Michelle said, "Look Mrs. Jones we picked you flowers and June did her ABCs." Mrs. Jones wanted to be mad at them but their smiles warmed her heart. "Thank you dear.

What did the mouse look for at night?
A little mouse lived in a little house.  The mouse would hurry along the walls at night looking for food.  Sometimes he'd find frosting from a cake.  Those were good days.  Sometimes he'd find paint from a paint can.  Those were bad days.  Either way, he'd always get scared whenever the phone rang.  It was so loud and made him jump.  Yesterday he tripped over a wire because he wasn't looking where he was going. The television was on full volume so no one saw it.  He loved running around in the kitchen.  There was always leftover food on a spoon in the sink.  Sometimes it was dried food and he'd have to scrape it off with his claws.  It still tasted good to the mouse.  He was so happy there were no other animals living around there.  He had heard a piggy ate a lot more than a mouse.  He didn't want to have to fight a piggy over food.  Life was really good for this little mouse.

How long did it take Albert to build the tree house?
A man named Albert had the choice to build a tree house, a garage, a desk, or a cabinet.  Albert chose to build something big to share with his kid, so he wanted to make a tree house.  Albert had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.  Wood is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.  Metal is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.  Plastic is not expensive, but it also bends a lot. The last choice was to give up, but Albert really wanted to do this for his son.  It would make him very happy.  Albert ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.  Albert went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.  He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.  He got started and it was very hard.  One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.  Finally, on the fifth hour, Albert finally finished the tree house.  His son ran out and jumped into his dad's arms.  They both looked at it, and Albert's son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.  Albert looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.  He had done it all by himself, and he was happy to see his son being so happy as well. They would have a long summer of playing together in the tree house that Albert built.  It was one of the best tree houses ever!

When they went to see the monkeys, Tracy even handed one of the monkeys a banana and the monkey ate it. But there was no panda. Everyone started to think there was no such thing as a panda.If Larry was going to see a panda, he would have find one himself. He packed up his backpack with sandwiches, a chocolate bar, and some water and he went out into the forest. He knew that a panda's favorite food was leaves, so made sure to pack some leaves in his backpack too. He spent two week in the forest looking everywhere for a panda. Finally, when has about to give up, he saw a family of pandas eating and playing. He gave them all the leaves in his backpack. He sat watching them for the rest of the day. He watched pandas bathe and climb trees. Then he went home and went to sleep.

What day was the race?
Greg and his mother were building a racing car. They were going to enter it into a race on Saturday. They began building the racing car on Monday. First, they had to build the body of the car. Greg wanted it to look like a strawberry! So they colored it red and put little dots all over it. On Tuesday, Greg's father helped them put the wheels on the racing car. His mother had to hold the car's body up when his father put the wheels on. On Wednesday, Greg and his mother colored in the number 8 on the car. This was Greg's lucky number! On Thursday, Greg and his mother tested the racing car at a park near the river. It went really fast! On Friday, Greg and his mother and father were outside in their backyard, still practicing with the racing car, making sure it went as fast as it could. Greg really wanted to win the race! On Saturday, Greg and his mother went to the race. It was being held on the track at his school. They put their racing car on the track, and a man started to count down from 10. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, GO! Greg pushed his car forward as fast as he could! It reached the finish line before everyone else! Greg won the race!

Who went to the baseball game and with how many people?
Joey went to a baseball game during the winter this year. He went by himself knowing he would enjoy the game much more than if he had gone with his friends Sam, Mark and David. His friends like to talk and hang out more than watch the game itself. The game was very exciting; Joey sat at the edge of his chair the whole game. The game ended with his home team winning by one run. The screams of the fans could be heard from very far away. On his way home he stopped at a dinner to have some dinner. When eating he saw some other fans come in and start belting out some songs and laughing. After dinner he looked at the menu and wanted some dessert. His choices were marshmallow and chocolate cake, apple pie with ice cream, warm brownies with ice cream, or a vanilla shake. He loved the taste of marshmallow so he went with that. On his way home he thought someone was tailing him so he turned off into a coffee store. When they drove by he went home.

One morning, Elena woke up, much like she did every day. She threw the covers on the floor and rolled out of bed, yawning hugely.

Elena was very worried. She liked Mr. Fish very much. She looked all around her desk, but here wasn't there. Then she looked on the floor behind the desk--and there he was! He was covered in dust bunnies and not moving. Elena picked him up and put him back in the bowl. And what do you know? He shook himself off and started swimming around again!

Billy was like a...
Billy was like a king on the school yard. A king without a queen. He was the biggest kid in our grade, so he made all the rules during recess. He was a big bully. He told kids what to do, what to play, what to sing, and called them names like "Dork". He always had a smile on his face as he sat on the bench next to the big tree and watched his "kingdom". All of the other kids were scared of him. Even I was scared of him. He was mean and he could beat you up if you made him angry. Last week, a very, very stupid kid chose not to listen to Billy. Billy beat him up and Mr.Stupid Kid told the grownups that he tripped. No one would dare get Billy in trouble. Billy was mean, but he kept the school yard from getting too crazy. Well I had enough it. Billy had been picking on us for too long and we had to stop him. I grabbed some fishing line from home and brought it to school the next day. Before recess, I tied a long piece of fishing line around the tree by Billy's bench and tied the other end to a big rock. Then I went inside for class. When it was recess, Billy sat on his bench and started yelling at people. This was it. I called out, "Hey you big dummy! You're not so tough". Billy's face turned red with anger and he started marching my way. Billy marched and then tripped over the fishing line. Billy was lying face down and he seemed to be crying. Everyone cheered. The king was down.

What did Billy buy at the farm?
Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.  When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars. Billy thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner. His brother was very happy with the dinner.  Billy's mom was also very happy.

Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.  When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars. Billy thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner. His brother was very happy with the dinner.  Billy's mom was also very happy.

Why did Grandpa answer the door?
The road to Grandpa's house was long and winding. There were lots of tall trees and animals in the woods. The trip took a long time because Jimmy was walking in his new boots and he wasn't used to them yet. He could have taken a ride to Grandpa's house, but that wouldn't be as fun. Jimmy liked to collect insects on the way to his Grandpa's house, so had picked the longer path. As he went along, Jimmy found more and more insects to add to his jar. His favorite was the lightning bug and he had found five of them total. He liked the moths too, but they were difficult to catch and took up a lot of space.Finally, Jimmy arrived at Grandpa's house and knocked. Grandpa answered the door with a smile and welcomed Jimmy inside. They sat by the fire and talked about the insects. They watched the lightning bugs light up as night came.

why was Sally picking out a dress?
Sally was looking through her closet for some clothes to wear to the school dance tomorrow night. She had a lot of clothes to look through, but she needed something perfect for the dance, since she would be seen by a lot of other people, and she wanted to stand out from the rest of the girls. There would be a lot of boys there, too. If she looked as nice as she imagined she could, she would have a lot of boys asking her to dance. And she didn't want to dance alone, because that would make her feel sad.  But she had to hurry, since it was getting late, and she had to sleep soon. She was so excited, that she barely touched her baked potato she had during suppertime. She also had chicken, some green beans, and corn on the cob.She came down to four choices for what she could wear to the dance. a pink dress, a green dress, a red dress, and a yellow dress. She tried on each one and looked at herself in the mirror to see how she looked. She chose the yellow dress, because it was the prettiest. After making her choice, she changed into her pajamas and got in bed. She turned the light out and fell asleep. She dreamed about the fun she would have at the dance. Sally smiled as she slept.

What kind of ice-cream was in the cone?
One day my dad was walking home and he had a big ice-cream cone. He had chocolate and vanilla and strawberry ice-cream on top of each other. He was moving his head back and forward to some music that he was playing when a spider dropped on his ice-cream for a little bite. My dad saw right away that a spider was on it and he brushed the spider off. After the spider was put on the floor, a fly flew into his ice-cream, right where the spider had been! Oh how terrible! My dad made the spider leave and right after that he saw an alligator come running up to him wanting a bite of his ice-cream too! My dad dropped his cone, ran away, and bought a yoghurt instead. He thought about buying a dingdong, but since dinner time was so close and he had such a big lunch, he thought a yoghurt would be better. It's a much safer and better dessert.  165 words.

Why did Scott want to go by the river?
Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again!"Oh, Boscoe!" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way.One of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, "Boscoe!" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river!As Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. "Boy, was that close!" Scott yelled out loud!That was the best adventure ever!

Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, "Boscoe!" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river!As Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. "Boy, was that close!" Scott yelled out loud!That was the best adventure ever!

Did James get a treat? What kind was it?
It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and James was going shopping with his mother. While she made her shopping list, James looked out the window. In the sky, he saw pretty birds. He smiled - James liked birds. He saw one last Friday when he was getting muddy in the puddles, and another on Wednesday when he was playing with his toy spaceship.Once his mother was done making her list, James got his shoes on before getting in the car. "Should I bring my jacket, Mom?" he asked. "No," his mother answered, fixing his hair, "it is warmer today than it was yesterday, in fact, it's hot!"James and his mother got in the car, and drove off to the store. He leaned his head on the car window, looking at the animals and trees they passed. He saw flowers, a puppy, ants, and people walking, and even a chipmunk! When they got to the store, James and his mother grabbed an empty shopping cart. James always liked helping his mother do her shopping - she sometimes let him get a treat if he was good. They went up and down the aisles, picking up the things on the list, including James' favorite food - peanut butter - and James was very well behaved.As they finished their shopping and walked to the front of the store in order to pay, James' mother said, "James, you can get a candy bar if you'd like, so I can say 'thank you' for being a super good helper today."James was so excited. He picked one with peanuts and chocolate, and placed it with the rest of their items. When they got home, James spent the rest of the day playing Legos in his room. It was a good day.

How many trees did John and Rick plant?
Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. John loved to eat peaches. In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.

Dave and John were playing catch in the living room.  Rose told them that was dumb, but she did not stop them.  She kept writing in her notebook. If they wanted to get in trouble, then they could.  It was not her responsibility.Dave told John to go long.  Dave did not have good aim and missed John's hands when he threw the ball.  Instead he hit the lamp and knocked it over.  He was glad he did not hit the dishes.  Nor did he hit the cat.  John was not glad that he hit the lamp, but was glad that the lamp was not broken.When John's dad came home, he was very happy that John came clean about the lamp even when it was not broken.

How did Ruth's father treat the cut?
Once there was a girl named Ruth, who loved to play outside whenever she could. One day, she was running around outside with a friend, but she tripped and scraped her knee very badly. She doubled over in pain, screaming for her father "DADDY!!!" she yelled, until he ran outside to help. "Thank goodness that only the skin on your knee was hurt!" he said, as he picked her up to bring her inside. "We need to cover your cut, and it looks like it was about to start raining anyway," he said. He brought her into the restroom, so he could wash the cut, then put on medicine and a large bandage. "That medicine hurt..." Ruth said, but her cut was feeling better than it did before. "Well, at least now you don't have to worry about it getting worse," her father said. "Hopefully it won't take long for your cut to get better, then you can go back to playing outside again - be careful from now on!"

What did the boy eat for breakfast?
A boy woke up super excited for this special day.  He could not contain his excitement knowing that the soccer final was today!  He had been working all year long to get to this day.  He quickly hopped off his bed and went to eat his breakfast.  His mom had made pancakes, waffles, and eggs, but the boy felt like eating cereal.  His mom had laid out his soccer clothes and after he was done with his breakfast, he couldn't wait to put them on.  He quickly changed into the clothes, and ran to the car where his mom was waiting for him to get in.  The ride seemed to take a long time as he was super excited to play.  The team was there and they started a small practice before the big game!  The game started and the boy was very nervous since the other team looked really good.  His team was as good too and they were tied at the end!  Everyone either got a trophy or a medal for playing in the game, and the boy got a trophy.  It was one of the best times the boy had ever had.  The day was starting to get dark and he could feel sprinkles on his hands. His parents asked the boy if he wanted to eat ice cream and pizza after the game.  The boy said he was tired and went home with his parents and he could not stop talking about how super fun the game was.  He talked and talked and talked and his parents were very proud of him.  He talked so much that he fell asleep in the car!  His dad carried him into the house and put him in his bed.  The boy had such a great day that he dreamed of soccer all night long.

Why can't the blue dinosaur play on the seesaw?
The pink rabbit is sitting on a bench in the park. The pink rabbit loves being at the park because she loves bird watching. She watches birds, and sometimes feeds them. She doesn't feed them corn, candy bars, or pizza. She feeds them sunflower seeds.Across from the pink rabbit, a blue dinosaur is sitting alone at a seesaw. The blue dinosaur likes playing on the seesaw because he thinks it's fun. The blue dinosaur is sad, because he can't ride on the seesaw by himself.The pink rabbit sees the blue dinosaur.

What did my sister and I do in the car and what could I not do?
One day, my family took a vacation to the beach. We were in our car for over 10 hours but it felt like we were in the car for maybe 11, 12, or 13 hours! We thought it would only be 8 hours, but we got lost. My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat. My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver. My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games. I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick. My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove. The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too! We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed. We were so tired from doing nothing all day! The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals! We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish! We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not. When it was lunch time we played with some chalk and mother made lunch. I was very happy and had a great vacation!

What color boots did Clementine buy, and what pair did she end up with?
Once upon a time, there was a cowgirl named Clementine. Orange was her favorite color. Her favorite food was the strawberry. She really liked her Blackberry phone, which allowed her to call her friends and family when out on the range. One day Clementine thought she needed a new pair of boots, so she went to the mall. Before Clementine went inside the mall, she smoked a cigarette. Then she got a new pair of boots. She couldn't choose between brown and red. Finally she chose red, which the seller really liked. Once she got home, she found that her red boots didn't match her blue cowgirl clothes, so she knew she needed to return them. She traded them for a brown pair. While she was there, she also bought a pretzel from Auntie Anne's.

Why did Billy smell the mix?
I love to bake cakes for my granddaughter Abigail. She gets so happy when she eats them! So one day, I thought I'd surprise her at school with cake for her school class! I thought that would make her love me even more.I went into the kitchen and washed my hands. Then I dried them on a dishtowel. I went to the refrigerator and took out my cake mix. Then I took out the special bottle of vanilla sauce! I always pour it in for Abigail. Her mom and dad like orange sauce, but Abigail loves vanilla sauce. I mixed it in with the cake mix, and put it on the table. Then I went to turn on the oven.Then, a bad thing happened! My friendly old cat Billy jumped up to smell the mix! Billy also loves vanilla sauce! But then Billy accidently kicked the mix! It fell all the way from the table to the ground.  My lip tightened as I started to cry.

Why was Jill sad after school?
Jill ran upstairs as soon as she got home from school. Today she was a sad and angry girl. Her teacher had given her a lot of homework. Jill always thought homework wasn't fair. But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun. When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks. She told it, "Mister Sparks, do my homework!" Then Jill had to go eat dinner. After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle. It was so much fun! But Jill got some bad news before going to bed. Mister Sparks had not done any of the homework!

But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun. When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks. She told it, "Mister Sparks, do my homework!" Then Jill had to go eat dinner. After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle. It was so much fun! But Jill got some bad news before going to bed. Mister Sparks had not done any of the homework!

What was under the table
The booger on the balloon sailed far and wide.  The wind pushed it.  The wind pulled it.  The booger on the balloon sailed into a house.  In the house was a table.  On the table was an orange.  Next to the orange was some chocolate.  Under the table was a crayon.  Under the crayon was a seed.  The booger on the balloon flew out of the house.  Outside, there was snow.  A dog went woof.  A cat went meow.  But the booger on the balloon did not hear them.  The booger on the balloon had no ears!  The wind blew the booger on the balloon far away, until one day......POP!The booger on the balloon fell on top of an alligator, never to be seen again.

What flavor was the punch meant to be?
It was the Fourth of July and Frank the cowboy had a meal planned. He was going to cook for the whole town and do it in a bear costume, which was what they did in his part of the nation to celebrate the holiday and was not weird at all. Unfortunately Frank had mistaken powdered soap for sugar because the eye holes in his bear costume didn't quite match up with his own eyes. He put the whole box of soap in the strawberry punch that he meant to give to his party guests."Try the punch," Frank said. Since they didn't want to be mean, after all Frank went through a lot of trouble in order to respect the town's bear costume wearing ways, the whole town drank the gross drink. No one got sick, but they were all pretty grossed out and after talking to each other planned to help Frank make the meal next year to keep it from happening again.

Where was the cub laying?
In a zoo, many animals have claws: birds, dogs and lions. Even some monkeys have claws! One summer day, the eyes of many visitors were facing the lion cage. It was like the famous movie "The Lion King". One lion cub had been born and was drinking from its mother. There was a straw bed for the lions to sleep on, and all visitors loved to watch the baby lion cub. Well, a monkey (with claws) came into the lion's cage all of a sudden! But the lions weren't afraid, because they are kings of the animal world. Also, they had seen the movie and knew what the monkeys wanted. So it happened that the monkey took the cub from its mother into its hands. It walked over to the gate by the visitors and held up the cub for all to see! People cried. People took pictures. They were seeing the real-life 'Lion King'!

What was the Grandmother's name?
Jessica went to sit in her rocking chair. Today was her birthday and she was turning 80. Her granddaughter Annie was coming over in the afternoon and Jessica was very excited to see her. Her daughter Melanie and Melanie's husband Josh were coming as well. Jessica had a lot to do before they got here, but she was very tired. After taking a nap for half an hour Jessica got up and walked to the drier. She moved the dry clothes into a basket. Next, she took the clothes out of the washer and put them into the drier. She pressed the button on the drier to get it started then walked back out of the room. She also needed to feed her duck. The chickens in her backyard did not need to be fed as they belonged to her neighbor. Jack the dog had been fed earlier that morning and Becky the cat always had food in her bowl. After Jessica finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing. She answered the phone to hear Annie's excited voice say "Happy birthday grandma!" Annie said they would be over very soon. Jessica smiled because she loved her family more than anything. She was very excited. She sat back on her rocking chair and waited until her family arrived.

What kind of animals liked the bottom of the tree?
There was once an old tree. The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree. The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it. Animals liked the tree as well. Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too! Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.One day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down. This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad. Why was it being cut down? Was it too old? Too weak? Maybe it was dying? The children learned it was because the tree was sick.The children were very sad to hear about this. They wondered where they would play from now on. The tree was their favorite place and they didn't want to see it go. One little boy, named John, went home to tell his parents the story. His parents could tell he was sad so they told him something that made him very happy. What was it? He wondered. Was a jungle gym going to be put in? A mall, maybe a park? In fact, even better than that, a new tree would be planted in its place.John was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends. "Big news!", he shouted. "My parents told me a new tree is going to be planted here over the old one!" All his friends cheered in excitement, now knowing they wouldn't lose their favorite spot. John and his friends went to celebrate by getting ice cream. His friends liked chocolate and vanilla but John got strawberry.

On Sunday, our family went for a picnic.  Mom, dad, Alice, Sissy (our dog), and I got in the van and drove to the park.  Alice and I played fetch with Sissy.

They were delicious, I ate two!  Alice only ate one hamburger.  I didn't like the salad because I don't like carrots.  Mom says they're good for me.  Sissy doesn't like carrots either.

He went to the grocery store and pulled all the pudding off the shelves and ate two jars. Then he walked to the fast food restaurant and ordered 15 bags of fries. He didn't pay, and instead headed home.His aunt was waiting for him in his room. She told James that she loved him, but he would have to start acting like a well-behaved turtle.After about a month, and after getting into lots of trouble, James finally made up his mind to be a better turtle.

What did Susan do with the dirt she swept up?
Susan was very happy to get some money from her grandmother. She spent all morning at her grandmother's house doing chores for her. Grandmother was getting older, and sometimes she needed help with small things around the house. The first thing that Susan did was clean the big window in her house. It was afternoon and the sun was shining, but it was hard to tell because the window was so dirty! Susan used water and soap to clean the window. It was very clean when she was finished. Next, she swept the front porch. She put all of the dirt and leaves into a big bin in the front yard. That was a lot of work. Susan was going back in the house for lunch when she saw that the light in the hall was out. She asked her grandmother to show her where the light bulbs were at so that she could change it. Since she was so short she had to get a stool to stand on. Her grandmother stood by to make sure she didn't fall. This was her last job of the day. After all of her hard work her grandmother made her a ham sandwich with no cheese. Susan did not like cheese. Then her grandmother gave her five dollars for helping. This was a whole dollar more than she got the last time!

Where was Pauly when the zoo worker saw him?
It was a terrible day to live in the zoo again for Pauly. It wasn't a terrible day for Zip, the monkey next to him, or Garth, the giraffe down the sidewalk, or Pat, the alligator in the pond, or for Bam the prairie dog, but it was a terrible day in the monkey cage for Pauly. Pauly didn't feel he belonged in the monkey cage because he wasn't a monkey. He was a sailor who had visited the zoo on vacation and fallen asleep on a bench right before closing time. The zoo worker saw how hairy he was and thought he was a monkey that had escaped from his cage, so they put him in a cage. Pauly knew if he didn't sleep so deep, none of this would have happened. He tried to tell the zoo worker the next morning he wasn't a monkey, but the zoo worker knew monkeys liked to play tricks and thought Pauly was a talking monkey that was trying to trick him. Soon, the zoo worker told others about the talking monkey, and Pauly became famous. People came from all over to see him. When the zoo was closed at night Pauly passed the time teaching the real monkeys how to sail. One day Pauly was asking the people watching him to shave him when James, another sailor on vacation, who knew Pauly, saw him. When he did, the sailor yelled, "That's no monkey, that's Pauly!" The zoo worker saw his mistake and sent Pauly away with James in time to join the boat to sail home.

What color rain boots did the tiny pig wear?
There was once a tiny pig who lived on a farm. He was a very cute animal, and he knew it. He liked to stay clean and soft and look as good as he could. When he had to go in the mud, he always wore black rain boots, a black rain hat, and a yellow rain coat. This helped keep the mud off. He didn't want it getting on his soft pink skin.This tiny pig lived with his aunt, who loved to get dirty. "You shouldn't stay so clean!" she told him. "We're pigs! We love the mud!" But the tiny pig kept wearing his boots, coat, and hat. One day, all the pigs were standing and eating their lunch. They had corn, oats, apples, and bread, and they all dug in. But the tiny pig wouldn't eat any of it. He had left his bib at home and didn't want to get his clothes dirty. He stood and looked sad as the other pigs ate their fill. They were getting brown mud all over them."Come on," said his aunt. "You can get some bread crumbs on yourself. It's okay." But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue. Suddenly, a car drove up. The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig. The tiny big was sad and mad. But then the people in the car got out. "Look at how cute that little muddy pig is!" said one. "He's so cute!" said the other. "Really?" said the tiny pig. "Yes!" said his aunt. "For the last time, everybody knows that pigs get muddy!"So the tiny pig went and dug in to the food with all the other pigs. He ate a big piece of bread. He got crumbs all over himself.

What type of fruits are in the basket?
Paul the pear lived in a bowl on the table. He was a plastic fruit, and no one could eat him. He sat in the bowl with Artie the apple and Gertie the grapes. He watched every day as the group of bananas that hung out in another basket got eaten one by one. He wished he could be taken along to work in a bag and brought along to eat. But day after day, he sat in the bowl with only his plastic friends. One day, a little boy walked over towards him and picked Paul up. Paul was very excited.

What time of day did Jack try to save the princess
One upon a time there was a dragon named Jack.  He was large and had big scales, but did not have claws or a mean look on his face like other dragons did.  He also didn't have wings and couldn't fly.  Jack lived near a castle that had a princess trapped in it.  This castle looked and was guarded by an evil dragon named Ryan. The castle was old and dirty.  It wasn't clean or special like many castles are thought to look.  One day Jack thought that he was going to try to save the princess Linda when Ryan was sleeping that night.  After sunset, he slowly walked around and climbed over the back wall.  After passing many sleeping guards, Jack put his nose near the princess's tower window. She climbed out on to it and they ran off.  During their escape, Ryan woke up and started chasing them.  However, he was too sleepy to catch them.  Jack took the princess to a nearby safe town where she thanked him and said goodbye.

What was Joey scared of?
Ginger and Joey were two young dogs. They were happy because it was now the summer and they could play outside more often. Today Ginger and Joey were running around in their big backyard. They had fun barking at many things. They barked at squirrels. They barked at a bus. They barked at the mailman. They barked at a weird bug. They barked so much, they were never quiet! The neighbor was a grumpy old man. His name was Bert. Bert threw a shoe at them because they were barking too much. He couldn't take a nap because they were so loud. Bert got too angry and Bert throws things when he gets too angry. The shoe missed both Ginger and Joey, but they barked a little less. Now they ran even faster. After a very long time, they began to get tired. They sniffed around the edges of the yard and found some old watermelon. That's a good snack for young dogs like Ginger and Joey! Next, they rolled around in the dirt. Then they chased their tails. Finally, their mom came out and told them to come inside. They were so dirty, they needed a bath. Ginger loved baths and jumped right into the tub. Joey was scared and ran away to hide. After a little bit, his mom found him and he got a bath in the end, too.

What was the witch's best treat she made?
The witch wanted to stop making poisons in her big pot.  She wanted to be a cook instead. She could make all sorts of treats, like blueberry sandwiches, orange pizzas, and grape pie.  Her best treat she made was strawberry eggs. She wanted the people from town to invite her to parties.  She wanted them to ask her to cook for them.  Most of all, she wanted them to be friends with her.  Her plan was to get them to try her strawberry eggs.  They were shaped like eggs but when you would chew on them they tasted like strawberries. They also had medicine in them so they would help people too. They were delicious.  Finally the big day came.  The witch brought her cart into the town.  She was late to town because she got lost.  Then her wagon broke and she had to fix its wheel.    It was full of the strawberry eggs.  The witch started handed them out.  At first people were nervous.  They did not know the witch well.  They knew she was the witch who lived in the woods, all alone. They knew she had made poisons. But once the sheriff tried them, everyone started trying them.   After everyone in town had one, they put the witch on their shoulders and cheered for her, even the town's baker.  Finally the town's leader asked the witch if she would move into the town.

What sports did Tom play?
Tom was the best baseball player in his neighborhood. He also enjoyed playing basketball, but he wasn't very good at it. Every morning he would get up and go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite players. He loved the Yankees, and knew he would someday play for them. One day when Tom was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a long car and walked over to Tom. The man said that he worked for the Yankees, and was there to see Tom play! Tom was so excited he could scream! Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day. When he was done, the man told Tom that he was good enough to play for the Yankees, and to pack his things right away. Tom hurried home as fast as he could, and started to pack up all his clothes. His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing. "I'm going to play for the Yankees ma!" Tom said. Tom's mom was so excited that she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner. Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake! As Tom said goodbye to everyone, he couldn't help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long. "Don't worry son, we'll be at all the games cheering you on!" said his dad. This made Tom happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally made it.

Where was Tom when the man who worked for the Yankees talked to him?
Tom was the best baseball player in his neighborhood. He also enjoyed playing basketball, but he wasn't very good at it. Every morning he would get up and go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite players. He loved the Yankees, and knew he would someday play for them. One day when Tom was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a long car and walked over to Tom. The man said that he worked for the Yankees, and was there to see Tom play! Tom was so excited he could scream! Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day. When he was done, the man told Tom that he was good enough to play for the Yankees, and to pack his things right away. Tom hurried home as fast as he could, and started to pack up all his clothes. His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing. "I'm going to play for the Yankees ma!" Tom said. Tom's mom was so excited that she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner. Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake! As Tom said goodbye to everyone, he couldn't help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long.

Who was stuffing melons in the holes in the tree?
The chipmunks were busy getting ready for the winter.  Little Chip had never seen everyone so busy.  Chipmunks were running this way and that way.  Even his Granddaddy was helping out, stuffing melons up into the holes in the tree.  Aunt Chippa was clapping at everyone to hurry them up.  Little Chip wasn't sure what they were all doing.  His mom had told him, "Getting ready for winter" but Little Chip didn't know what that meant.  He sat on the seesaw trying to guess.  He knew that people were gathering things.  Now that he thought about it, they were gathering food!  Little Chip thought for a second...could they be gathering food for a party?  That couldn't be it, everyone was gathering so much food that not every chipmunk in the town could come close to eating all the food for a single party.  Little Chip looked at his big toe and thought.  He saw another chipmunk digging in the ground and stuffing more food there.  Was the guy trying to plant seeds to grow?  Seeds wouldn't grow in the winter, it's too cold!  Little Chip sat up and knew why everyone was so busy! Winter is coming!

What was in Timmy's package?
Last Saturday was the best day of Timmy's summer. After waking up at nine and turning on his lamp, Timmy ran downstairs, counting the steps as he always did. There were always seven. At the bottom, he jumped over his dog Lucky who was licking himself clean. Timmy took a bite of toast and a sip of the orange juice his mom Suzie had left on the table for him before running outside to check the mail. Before he made it down the steps, he almost tripped on a big package waiting for him. It was here! Timmy's birthday present from his grandmother Betty had arrived. He brought it into the kitchen, where his dad Ryan was waiting for him with a grin on his face. As Timmy tore into the package, he found the greatest present he could have asked for. It was a huge water gun! Timmy immediately filled it up and ran outside to begin playing. His neighbor Maeby came outside with her water hose after eating her sandwich and the two got in a water fight! Soon, Timmy's dad came outside to play too! He brought 11 water balloons. Soon all five of Timmy's friends were playing in the water with each other. Timmy's water gun was the best toy out there. It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water. Soon it was evening and Timmy's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for Timmy's friends and their families.

Soon all five of Timmy's friends were playing in the water with each other. Timmy's water gun was the best toy out there. It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water. Soon it was evening and Timmy's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for Timmy's friends and their families.

How old was Thomas?
It was one week before Halloween and Thomas still needed to find the perfect costume for trick-or-treating. Last year Thomas was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw. Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real. Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, "wait for me" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. "Great costume," they thought, "we'll have to do better next year" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.

Gia was new in the neighborhood. She really wanted to meet some new friends. She was lonely and tired of playing with her toys all by herself.

She sat on a swing and looked at the ground. It seemed like this was going to be another lonely day. Gia heard a noise and looked up. There was a girl coming down the hill. She smiled, but she was a little scared. What if she wasn't nice? That would make her sad. Gia was so happy when the girl walked up and said, "Hi, my name is Julie. What's yours?"

What was the dog's name?
Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty. If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house. Max didn't mind sleeping outside, because he could hear the train's whistle and he would dream all night about the train. The funny thing about Max was that he didn't like going for a drive with Bob in a car, on a bike or in a boat. The only way you get Max to go somewhere was on a train. Max must have been a train driver in a past life.

Who did the whistle belong to?
Lucy was walking with her family in the woods, far away from the city.  Her father helped her see all kinds of animals.  It was like going to the zoo.  They saw deer, a moose, a fox, and a bear.  The bear ran away when her brother shouted.  Lucy thought that was lucky, because she was a little scared of it.  Her father showed her a whistle to blow in case she got lost.  Her brother kept stealing it.  While they were walking down by a stream, Lucy's Mom was making sandwiches for everyone.  Lucy's brother Jim kept blowing the whistle.  He told her that he was going to steal her sandwich if he got there first.  That made her mad!  She really wanted her turkey sandwich and not a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  When their mom called, they both ran back as fast as they could.  Since Jim was older, he was faster and beat her to the picnic.  Lucy started crying.  She thought Jim stole everything!

They looked so happy.  Then it was her turn.  She spread her wings, closed her eyes and jumped out of the nest.  After a few seconds, she opened her eyes to see that she was actually flying.  Oh happy day!  It was everything her mother said it would be.  The world looked so big and Robin couldn't wait to see it all.

At the end of the story how did Sean make his bed green?
Sean the dragon liked the color green. He didn't like golden coins. They were too yellow. Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure. He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried.  When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.  They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.  One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. "What's that?" he asked.  "That's a green stone," she told him. "Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things."  "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" Sean asked. "Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire."  So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.  Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed.  Green stones never got old and brown.  They don't catch fire either.  So, now everyone was happy.

What did Rebecca want to do with a zebra?
Elizabeth jumped right out of bed on Saturday morning.  Today was the day her father was going to take her and her sister, Rebecca, to the zoo.  Her mother made them biscuits and eggs for breakfast.  The two girls were too excited to sit still.  They didn't even watch any cartoons before they left for the zoo in the car.  The first thing they saw was a zoo worker carrying a pail of fish.  He was going to feed the penguins.  The penguins looked funny walking on land but were very fast swimmers in the water.  Next, the girls ran to where the pandas live.  The pandas were playing by rolling down the hill.  After watching the pandas, the girls and their father moved to where the lions were.  One lion was asleep on his back but the others were in a circle eating some meat.  It did not look tasty.  The girls didn't want to watch this any more so they walked to where the zebras were eating grass.  Rebecca thought it would be fun to ride one like a horse.

Sam was driving. It was late, it was dark, it was raining, and he was out of cookies. His squirrel was asleep in the passenger seat, as was his hamster, in the back seat. He had gone down to the beach for the day, but it had started raining, so he had started driving back. But he had gotten lost. Now, he thought he was on the right way back.His headlights were not very strong. He could only see a few feet in front of him, except when the lightning hit. When the thunder came after, his squirrel, Joey, and his hamster, Broey, turned over in their sleep.Suddenly, lightning and thunder hit at the same time. There was a bright light and a crunching sound. A tree fell in front of the car!Sam hit the brakes. The car slowed down and stopped, and he got out. Sam walked up to the tree. He tried pushing it. It was too heavy. What would he do?He heard the car door open and shut behind him.It was Joey! And Broey!Together, the three of them pushed. Joey and Broey were small, but strong.

Where does the chipmunk put his ear?
At night, the magical chipmunks come out to play in the woods. They shower in bowls, and take pictures with their phones. They brush their teeth until they twinkle. They hide in the bushes and play games. There is one game they really like. To play, one chipmunk puts his ear on the phone, and another hides in the woods with a different phone. One chipmunk walks through the woods looking for the hiding chipmunk. The hiding chipmunk tells 'hot' or 'cold' to the first one on the phone. If 'hot', he is very close to finding! If 'cold', he's very far away! Chipmunks love to be hot, so there is a twist to this game!

What was the name of the granddaddy's daughter?
Once there was a granddaddy named Tom who hadn't seen his daughter Rachel in many years. Rachel had a daughter of her own named Melissa, but she and Tom had had a fight before Melissa was born. Because of that, Tom had never met Melissa. Tom's wife Marge had died many years before, so he lived alone. He liked living alone, but he missed Rachel. Tom spent most of his time working in his garden. He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes. He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them. He liked zucchini and spinach, but he didn't have any of those plants to plant. One day Tom got a call on his phone. He picked it up and asked who it was. The voice on the other end of the line said, "It's me, Rachel." Tom was so surprised he almost dropped the phone. He said, "Rachel, is it really you? I can't believe it." Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight. Tom was so happy. They were going to meet the next weekend. Even before he hung up, Tom could imagine himself hugging his daughter. He sat down and thought about everything he wanted to say to her.

Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight. Tom was so happy. They were going to meet the next weekend. Even before he hung up, Tom could imagine himself hugging his daughter. He sat down and thought about everything he wanted to say to her.

Who did Alex call?
Alex was right next to his close friend when he heard a strange noise. He was afraid of this noise so he built a shield. From behind the shield, Alex had to shout, "Who is there?" Then he saw an animal that had a green stripe across its back. Alex was scared. Then the animal stepped into a plate filled with frosting and the animal slipped and fell on the ground. Alex had to be quiet so he could get to the out and to the playground without the animal hearing him. After he was far enough away, Alex started to run very fast. He ran and ran until he finally made it to the playground where he hid for the rest of the day in the sand box. When he felt safe he called his mother and had her pick him up and get away. When his mom got there, Alex said, "Thank you for coming to get me mom, I was so scared." His mom told him, "You are very welcome Alex. I'm here whenever you need me."

Which cup was the ball in at the end of the trick?
There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.

What way did Grandpa and Andrew get to the river to go fishing?
Andrew waited for his granddaddy to show up. They were going fishing. His mom had packed them a lunch. She had made Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches. She also packed a bottle of nice cool water to drink. Andrew had wanted something else for lunch. He wanted chicken or cold cuts or left over meat loaf, but his mom sent Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches. The best way to get to the river was along the path. When the path ended, they needed to go through the bushes to the river. On some days they would think about going another way. They could go over the bridge, or through the back of the house or through Uncle Tom's yard. Today they took the path to the river. Andrew found some animal poop along the path. He asked his Grandpa what kind of animal poop he had found. He wanted to know if it was a lion, a tiger or a bear that had made the poop. Grandpa pointed in the bushes. Andrew saw a small black and white animal looking at him with big eyes. Andrew knew that he had was looking at a raccoon. He was sure that the raccoon had made the poop. When Andrew and Grandpa got to the river they put their fishing poles into the water. Andrew caught his first fish right away. He caught a second fish before lunch. He got hungry and had his Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich and cool water. He saw that Grandpa had fallen asleep. After eating his lunch, Andrew caught three more fish before he woke up his grandpa. When Andrew and Grandpa got back home they gave all the fish they had caught to Andrew's mother, so she could make a good dinner.

The girls thought they saw a wolf, but what did they really see?
Molly and her friend Jessica liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.  They would almost always play in the woods behind Molly's house. They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!

What did the sandcastle have at the top?
Billy and Sara are brother and sister. They went to the beach with their family last July for a week, and had the best time ever!  On Monday, Billy and Sara wanted to build a giant sandcastle.  They invited their new friends Jack and Jane to help build the sandcastle. Jack and Jane had a house on the beach, so they were really good when it came to building sandcastles.  They hoped that they could make the sandcastle taller than themselves, but they soon found they needed more help. They asked their cousin Joey to help them build the biggest sandcastle in the world! Joey wasn't the friendliest cousin in the world, but to Billy and Sara's surprise, Joey was happy to help build the sandcastle. Billy, Sara, Jake, Jane and Joey had spent the whole day building the sandcastle, and finally, right before dinner time, they completed it. The sandcastle was huge! It had a river around the castle, and even a bridge to cross the river. It even had a flag at the top, and a wall that went around the castle too!  They were so happy! \tabThe rest of the week at the beach was a lot of fun for Billy and Sara. On Tuesday, they went for ice cream. Sara's ice cream fell and dripped all the way down to her tummy, but Billy gave her some of his. On Wednesday, they watched the fireworks at night. On Thursday, they went swimming all day long, moving like worms in the water. On Friday, they had to go back home. They were sad, so they started counting down the days until next year at the beach!

What was the name of Fred's best friend?
There was once an octopus who lived under the ocean. His name was Fred. Fred had never seen the world above the ocean before. He had spent all of his life under water with his friends, a blow fish named Joey, a sponge named Pam, a star fish named Elaine, and another octopus, Stacey. So you can imagine his surprise when he found a treasure chest that had been lost by a ship that had sunk. Inside the chest were things that were completely new to him. Among these was a whole bunch of food items, such as a bottle of ketchup, a coffee mug, a cherry pie, a sandwich, and more. When Fred found these things, he wanted to keep them all for himself. So when he returned to his friends, he didn't tell them what he had found. When his best friend Stacey asked him where he had been, Fred lied and said that he had only gone for a swim. But Stacey didn't believe him. Later on, when Fred was sound asleep in his bed, Stacey visited his room to see what he had been up to. She went digging around in his room for something interesting. When she found the treasure chest, she was amazed at what was inside. But she was also upset at Fred for lying to her, so she woke up him in the middle of the night to yell at him. Fred understood his mistake and apologized to Stacey, and then they shared the food.

Why did Emma want to go to the grocery?
Her mother had packed the best lunch she could for Emma. Emma was thankful, but it was only a turkey sandwich with lettuce on it. Her mother meant well, but Emma could only eat this turkey so many times before she got sick of it. Emma thought she wanted something tastier to eat. She took her bike around the block and locked it to the birdbath in front of the grocery. That is when Emma found the most delicious looking tomatoes stocked on grocery's shelves. She took one down from the top shelf that looked very good and made her way to the front of the store. Jim, the man at the front of the store, gave her a warm smile and told her how much her tomato would cost. She used the money her mother had given her for a book to pay. She hid her prize in her bag and then made her way back to her apartment. Emma's mother was in the back room she could safely cut up the tomato and place it on her sandwich without her mother knowing because she knew her mother would be upset. Emma's mother had given allowance to buy a book for school, not a tomato. The young girl smiled to herself as she took a bite into her sandwich.

How did Lucy find her way back with Jessie?
Lucy was a young lady bug.  She always felt different from the lady bugs because her colors were reversed!  Instead of a red body and black spots she had a black body and red spots!  As you can imagine this left Lucy feeling pretty lonely so she spent a lot of time flying around to all the different areas to find other ladybugs like her.

She also loved flying so much because it gave her a feeling of being free.  One day when she was flying around she heard a loud scream for help!  She went as fast as she could towards the screams for help.  She saw another lady bug with a broken wing lying on the ground.  She knew the lady bug as Jessie."What happened?!" asked Lucy."I crashed into the tree flying home yesterday and I've been lost ever since.  I can't fly because my wing is broken.

Why does Lucy like flying?
Lucy was a young lady bug.  She always felt different from the lady bugs because her colors were reversed!  Instead of a red body and black spots she had a black body and red spots!  As you can imagine this left Lucy feeling pretty lonely so she spent a lot of time flying around to all the different areas to find other ladybugs like her.  She loved to feel the wind in her wings as she flew.  She spent so much of her time flying around so she could fly longer and faster than another other lady bug.  She also loved flying so much because it gave her a feeling of being free.  One day when she was flying around she heard a loud scream for help!  She went as fast as she could towards the screams for help.  She saw another lady bug with a broken wing lying on the ground.  She knew the lady bug as Jessie."What happened?!" asked Lucy."I crashed into the tree flying home yesterday and I've been lost ever since.  I can't fly because my wing is broken. Do you know the way back home?" asked Jessie"Don't worry Jessie, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!" Lucy said happily."Thank you so much!" Jessie said happily.Lucy led Jessie straight home where he was given medicine to fix his broken wing.  She was rewarded a medal and called a hero.  As she enjoyed her medal she knew she didn't need to find for any more ladybugs that looked like her.  She now knew that even with her different colors, she was still a lady bug like everyone else.

Why didn't Jason's dad take him to the zoo this Tuesday?
Tuesdays during the summer tickets are buy one get one free at the city zoo. Jason loves animals, so his dad takes him to the zoo every Tuesday in the summer. This Tuesday Jason's dad is feeling sick so his mommy has to take him to the zoo. There is also a new animal that Jason can't wait to see; a rattle snake. Tuesday morning Jason's mommy wakes him up, and they get in the car to drive to the zoo. On the car ride Jason's favorite song "The Wheels on the Bus" plays on the radio. Jason's mommy turns the radio louder and they sing the song together. When they get to the zoo they go straight to the rattle snake cage, but when they get there they don't see any rattle snakes. They look around for a little bit, and all they see are some eggs. A man who works at the zoo tells them that the rattle snake must be sleeping and that it hides when it sleeps. Jason is sad because he might not get to see the rattle snake today. They walk away from the rattle snake cage and Jason's mommy buys Jason an ice cream cone to cheer him up. After walking around the zoo and seeing other animals like a bear and a monkey, Jason wants to check the rattle snake cage one more time. They get to the cage and to Jason's surprise the rattle snake is awake and moving around. Not only does he get to see the snake, but a baby is being born from one of the eggs too. Jason is very happy and excited about what he saw in the rattle snake cage and can't wait to get home and tell his dad.

Where was John taking the bus?
John woke up. It was Tuesday, and he was at home. He was still sleepy, but his alarm clock was ringing and he knew he had to be on time for school. He wished it were Saturday or Sunday. He yawned, got out of bed, and put on his slippers. Then, he walked to the bathroom, where he brushed his teeth and washed his face. Still in his pajamas, he went down to the kitchen. His mother, Sylvia, greeted him with a glass of orange juice and a big bowl of cereal. He was still kind of sleepy, but he drank his juice and ate his cereal. When John was done with his breakfast, he went upstairs and got his school clothes on. Then it was time to catch the bus to school. John hated the bus, because he was quiet and the bus was always loud. Plus there was always some kid who thought it was funny to make gross jokes or say bad words. Today, John was ready for the bus. With the sandwich and potato chips in his lunchbox, he had some cake he had made yesterday. He had used salt to make the cake instead of sugar. He knew it tasted horrible, and he was going to give a piece of cake to the first person who was bad on the bus, and he didn't even care if he got in trouble. His friends Anne, Margaret, and Charlotte were in on it, too. He sat in the house, a little excited, eating an apple and waiting until it was time to leave the house. It was time! He put on his shoes and left.

What did Jill need to buy to make her pie?
It was time for Jill to make her famous apple pie, out of the yellow apples that grew on her land. It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy. She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour. She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour. While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk. She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner. At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies. After she had finished her shopping, Jill went to the library to get some books, to the car wash to wash her car, and to her mother's house to say hello. She went home after, and made her yummy pies.

Where was the last place Jill went before going home?
It was time for Jill to make her famous apple pie, out of the yellow apples that grew on her land.

She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking.

When do Julie and Rosie eat breakfast?
One morning Julie took her dog, Rosie, for a walk. Rosie loved to walk outside. She loved to walk any time - morning, afternoon, or night. She liked to smell everything. This morning she smelled something new. It was another animal. It was not a squirrel. It was not another dog. Maybe it was a tiger! Rosie sniffed around until she saw the other animal. It was not a tiger. It was a cat. The cat was watching Rosie. The cat was afraid Rosie would try to bite her, so she climbed up a tree. Rosie tried to follow her, but she could not climb up. Instead, she barked at the cat in the tree. Julie did not want Rosie to scare the cat. She called Rosie away from the tree. The cat watched them walk away. When they came back, the cat was gone. Rosie remembered the cat. She started digging in the dirt under the tree. But there was no cat there. Julie and Rosie went home for breakfast.

Which one of Ralph's brothers is the meanest?
Ralph was an alligator that loved to splash around in the water. Ralph had three brothers, named Henry, Larry, and Thomas. But none of Ralph's three brothers liked to play in the water. They were very mean brothers, but the meanest of them all was Henry. Henry would always chase Ralph around the lake and try to beat him up when he was splashing around. Then on his birthday, Ralph thought of a great idea. His idea was to stop Henry from beating him by using a trick. He would trick Henry into thinking one side of the lake was scary. Ralph dressed up in a spooky costume and waited for Henry to swim over to the side of the lake. Then when Henry came over, Ralph started making spooky sounds and scared Henry back to the other side of the lake. Henry was so scared he never came to the other side of the lake again and Ralph was free to splash around in peace.

Marcel lived on a farm. Every morning when he woke up, he got dressed, washed his face, and then helped his Pa with the chores before having breakfast. After breakfast, he walked with his sisters to the school in the town. One day on his way to school, Marcel remembered he left his books on the table. "Oh no!" he said. "I forgot my books!"His older sister Lucianne frowned. "Oh, Marcel, how could you be so forgetful? You'll have to go home and get them."Marcel's younger sister Paula was excited. "I can go get your books for you," she said."No," Marcel said. "You're too young to go home by yourself. It'll have to be me.""Be careful," Lucianne warned him.

What did the doctor check when he was seeing Joey?
Joey went to the doctor yesterday. He was a little scared because he might have to get a shot, but his mother promised that it wouldn't hurt. During the time they were in the waiting room, Joey played with some blue and green blocks and some toy cars that the doctor kept there for the children who came to see him. He also met another little boy named Bobby who also had to see the doctor. Bobby liked playing with the cars more than the blocks, but Joey liked playing with both of them. Joey also met a little girl named Sandy who was playing with some dolls the doctor also had for the children. When it was Joey's turn to see the doctor, his mother led him into one of the rooms and had him sit on a yellow chair. The doctor was a friendly man who wore glasses. He took Joey's temperature and looked in his ears, then asked him a few questions about how he had been feeling. When Joey said his throat hurt a little, the doctor took a look at it as well. He said everything looked okay, and Joey wouldn't need any shots this visit. On the way out Susan the nurse let Joey take a red lollipop from a basket on her desk. By the time Joey got home, he thought the doctor wasn't so scary after all.

Where did the guy live?
Once there was a guy who lived in a giant red mitten. He was always mad because the old woman in the shoe down the road got all the attention for living in a giant piece of clothing. One day he made a plan to play a joke. He took a cookie and with it in his hand went to dig a hole under the old lady's shoe. When he finished digging he hid the cookie in the hole and then went to the zoo. He stole a bunch of monkeys which he took back to the lady's shoe house. The TV news team was talking to her on camera that day outside her house about how great she was for living in a shoe and how smart and cool she was. The guy stood there listening with his bag of hungry monkeys. At the very second the news team took a close up of the shoe with their big camera the guy opened the bag and freed the monkeys. He had told them earlier that hidden somewhere in the house was a cookie. He laughed very loud as he imagined them tearing up her house on live TV. But instead of doing that, they stood around looking bored because monkeys like bananas not cookies.

What did Steve write on the stone?
Steve had a very long finger. It was the longest finger anyone in his town had. One day Steve shut the toilet seat, and his finger got caught in it. He couldn't get it out. It was very cold in the bathroom. This is why his sister brought him a coat. He was in the bathroom a long time. So, Steve started pasting a stone on the wall with glue on the end of his brush. Then he wrote the truth on this stone. He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue. He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling. He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister. It was too late, she saw that he wrote the truth on the stone. So he let her see his power. With a twirl of his long finger he magically made the toilet seat lift up.

Then he wrote the truth on this stone. He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue. He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling. He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister. It was too late, she saw that he wrote the truth on the stone. So he let her see his power. With a twirl of his long finger he magically made the toilet seat lift up. He could make things move with his mind.

Sarah's New Kitty"Meow."Sarah eyes opened wide when she heard that sound coming from the basket her mother was holding."Mama, what's that sound?

But we do not know how to build a boat to get there."Tommy smiled.  "I have plenty of toy boats," he said.  "They are your size!""Oh, thank you!" said Steve, the other little mouse.  "We would be very glad if we could borrow it!"Tommy went to his house and returned with a small toy boat.  The boat had a big sail to make the boat go.  Mary and Steve climbed on and Tommy put the boat into the water.The boat sailed away across the water!  Mary and Steve laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat.Soon, they reached the other side of the lake.  Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water.  Steve and Mary loved seeing all the new things and people.A man threw a ball into the water.  It landed by the toy boat.  The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it.  The big waves splashed the little boat every which way!  Mary and Steve got very wet.Mary and Steve went back home after that.

Who travels from home to home delivering gifts?
Santa Claus makes sure that every year at Christmas time that his reindeer are ready to deliver gifts to girls and boys all over the world. Without the reindeer, how would Santa fly from home to home? The most important thing that Santa has to do for the reindeer is to make sure they have their coffee on Christmas Eve. Without the coffee, they won't stay awake for very long. Sleeping reindeer are not very helpful. Santa also gives the reindeer candy to keep up their energy. In the North Pole, the main candy is candy canes in red and white. Reindeer love the candy canes that are different colors best and Santa says that helps them fly faster. Next, Santa has to make sure that the reindeer have a good meal before they go. Santa wants to make sure he doesn't have to share the cookies kids leave for him. The last thing Santa has to do is make sure the reindeer know where they are going. Santa has only been lost one time on Christmas Eve and he does not want that to happen again.

What did Jerry think the clouds looked like?
A man named Jerry lived in a small town in the state of Kentucky.  Jerry owned a sheep farm.  His favorite time of year was when lambs were born.  They were very cute.  Jerry also had other animals on his farm, such as pigs, dogs, cats, and cows.  One day Jerry wanted to paint his barn.  He could not find his ladder.  He looked in the barn, in his house, in his garage, and in his field.  Since he could not find it he had to stand on a table.  It took Jerry six days to paint his barn that way.  Jerry's favorite activity was to sit on his porch and sip lemonade.  He would watch the clouds float by in the sky.  He thought they looked a lot like his sheep.  Every night when Jerry went to sleep, he would listen to the sound of the wind blowing across the fields on his farm.  He would dream about feeding his sheep.

How did the pumpkin escape the garden?
There once was a pumpkin.  The pumpkin was sad.   The pumpkin wanted to leave the garden and see the world.  But the pumpkin had to stay in the garden because its vine held it there.  One day a fox came by.  The pumpkin asked the fox to cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden.  The fox said it would cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden.  When the fox cut the vine the pumpkin could roll around.  The pumpkin rolled around until it got out of the garden.  First it met a cat.  It told the cat it was happy because now it could see the world.  The cat gave the pumpkin a piece of cake to eat.  The pumpkin could not eat the cake because it had no mouth but it was still very happy to have the cat as a new friend.

Which of the following grades did not share recess with Mrs. Snooter's class?
Every day at noon, when it was time for recess, Mrs. Snooter would honk a loud horn. This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.The students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.First, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.If a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.Finally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students. Most of the time, he was the winner of the race, and would play on the seesaw with his friends.

What did Will put in the trashcan?
Will was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  Will stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  Will walked over to the living room.  On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.  When he was in the living room, it started to rain.  It stopped raining and Will walked all the way to the store.  When at the store, Will had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.  Will heard it start to thunder.  Will looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.  Will was happy he didn't have to get wet walking home.  He went outside smiling.

What time did they have to wake up to climb the mountain?
I once went on a week-long backpacking trip through the mountains. We had a lot of fun and saw a lot of animals. We saw two bears on the first. We also saw one buffalo. During the week we climbed four different mountains. The best day of the trip was the last day. On the last day we heard that one of best things to do was to climb the last mountain at night so that way you could watch the sunrise on top of the mountain. We had to wake up at two in the morning to do the climb. It was very tough to climb a mountain at night. We finally got to the top of the mountain at five in the morning. We watched the sunrise an hour later at six in the morning. It was very beautiful. In fact, at one time because of the rise of the mountain you it was daytime in front of us and nighttime behind us. This was one of the best times in my life.

Barry the bowl lived in a cabinet in the kitchen. He sat next to the pots and under the pans. He liked his home, but he never got out much. He was only used for mixing when his friend wanted to bake a cake. One day, his friend pulled him out of the cabinet and put him on the table. He got out the eggs, flour and sugar and began to bake a cake. Barry was very excited. He looked around the kitchen as his friend mixed up all the ingredients. He saw a sink, a refrigerator and a toaster. He was sad to go back in the cabinet when his friend was all done with the cake. But he wasn't going back yet!

During the day, where would Harry put Tom?
One day, Harry bought a pet hamster name Tom. Tom was round and furry and had a funny smell. Harry loved it when Tom would climb up his arm and into his shirt sleeve. Every day before bed Harry would put Tom into his cage and every morning Harry would take Tom out of his cage and carry him around in his front shirt pocket during the day. Harry would carry Tom everywhere he went. Harry's favorite thing to do was to watch Tom run around in his exercise wheel. Then one day Harry woke and to find that Tom was not in his cage. Tom had gone missing! This made Harry very upset. He looked everywhere for Tom, wondering where he could have disappeared to. Harry called his friends John, Rodney, and Bruno to ask if they knew where Tom was. They said that they didn't know. So Tom asked them if they would help him look for Tom. Only John and Bruno said "yes". to help Harry. After looking for Tom for two hours Bruno found Tom inside an old sock behind Harry's desk. No one knew how he got there.

What was the hamster's name?

Why are Albert and his friends looking for a building?
There once was an alligator named Albert (who wore an office shirt). He had two good friends - Lock the cat and Gary the hamster. Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. "If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!" yelled Gary, who was cold. "Don't worry, no one's going to die!" yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary. Luckily, they found a house after leaving the forest, which happened to be near the ocean. They ran inside, and dried off, before they headed to sleep.

What was the first big kid ride that Megan rode on?
One day there was a six year old little girl named Megan who lived in a big house with her family.  She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad.  Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.  Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.  Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland.  For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.  Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, "Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!"  Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.  Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.  At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.  Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.  She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.  Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.

What was Oink's dream?
There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.

What type of animal stole Kevin's car keys?
There once was a boy named Kevin.  He met Jessica one afternoon at a park on a hot summer day.  They both started talking and became great friends.  They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  Kevin sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.  There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole Kevin's car keys when he was eating!  Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of Kevin right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.  The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left Kevin and Jessica alone.  Kevin thought that maybe next time he could go to the park in the early spring or winter so that the chipmunks would be busy sleeping during the cold weather months.  Kevin then said goodbye to Jessica and went home.

What flavor of frozen yogurt did Sally choose?
Sally always loved the ocean. Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she couldn't sleep the night before. Tonight was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day. When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun. The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close! Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too. Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. Sally couldn't choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor "Tropical Turtle". The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.

Where did we go when we left the park?
While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street. "Can we get ice cream, Nana?" asked Tina. "Sure we can!" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. "Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!" Laughing at what was said, I answered, "If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!" Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. "Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?" she asked. "If that is what you want, you sure can!" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class. "Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?" "Let's go!" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. "That is okay", she said, "Butterflies need to be left out to fly free".  Mary asked Tina if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.

What is the name of the boy monster?
Once upon a time there was a boy monster named Jerry who lived in a train car at the railroad tracks. He had lived there all his life. Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36. Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone.

What was the name of the kitten?
This story takes place in a faraway land.  One day, in this magical kingdom a happy little kitten, named Lucy, was walking down the road.  As she turned the corner, she came upon a frog who had badly hurt his leg trying to jump over a puddle.  The kitten looked down at the frog and asked him if he needed any help.  The frog said, "Oh, yes.  My name is Sammy.  I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.  I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock."  The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.  She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.  When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.  The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.  As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.  In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends.

How did the frog hurt himself?
This story takes place in a faraway land.  One day, in this magical kingdom a happy little kitten, named Lucy, was walking down the road.  As she turned the corner, she came upon a frog who had badly hurt his leg trying to jump over a puddle.  The kitten looked down at the frog and asked him if he needed any help.  The frog said, "Oh, yes.  My name is Sammy.  I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.  I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock."  The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.  She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.  When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.  The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.  As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.  In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends.

What did the witch give the child?
A single parent took their child on a trip. The trip was to the playground. The child had a fear of the playground, because she had dug a hole and it had made her trip once. The parent put the child on the sofa and put her shoes on, telling her that it would be alright, and they would be back home by nine. At the playground, the child met a witch. The witch had a piggy with her. The witch stood in the middle of the street. She had a broom. The child wondered what there was to sweep at the playground. Instead, the witch made a chicken, and gave some of it to the child. The witch was saying that it was a gift for her. She thought a gift would help the child with her fear. The child ate the chicken. Then she asked the witch a question. She asked what the witch had a broom for. The witch laughed. She told the girl it was to fly with. The girl did not believe her. The witch sat on her broom and flew away. In the distance, a dog howled.

Why didn't Jack's friends say hello to him?
When summertime came Jack the Pirate made up his mind it was time to get his hair cut.He told all his friends that it was because he wanted a new look. But the truth was the Sun was too hot for Jack the Pirate. His long hair only made it worse.So he left his home by Whipple Creek and went into town to visit the Edward the Barber at his barbershop. It was fun getting his hair cut, and when it was done Jack the Terrier felt fresh and cool."Your friends won't even know it's you, Jack!" said Edward the Barber as Jack the Pirate headed out the door.On the way back home, he took a short cut through the forest, and he met three people who were his friends. First he met Ichabod the Chief of Police, who was doing an important case. Jack said "Hello, Ichabod!" but Ichabod ignored him. The second person he met was Willy the Candy Man, who was delivering delicious treats. Jack said "Howdy, Willy!" but Willy didn't say anything back. The third person Jack met was Dean the Librarian, who was looking for a book he had lost. Jack said "Hey, Dean!" but Dean didn't stop looking for his book."That's odd," thought Jack to himself, as he arrived home. "Why did all of my friends ignore me today?"Then he looked in the mirror and saw why. He looked like a totally different person. His friends must not have even known it was him!

How did Hugo get to Etopit
There once was a giant orange farm in space. No human had ever been there before. It could not be reached by plane, spaceship, car, or any other means of travel. The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 1032. They owned the planet the farm was on, called Etopit. In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm. On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth. Hugo was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours. Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space. He told them his name was Tiddlywink, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from Etopit's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges. Rufus and Xenon told him all their secrets. Hugo wrote all of them down, then sneezed so hard he went back to Earth! With his help, Earth has now become the best place to grow oranges.

What animal was Timmy?
A tiger named Timmy and Bear named Buster were going for a walk in the park by the river and were going to go swim later. As Timmy was running through a field in the park he came upon a small hamster with a broken leg. The hamster looked like it had somewhere to go but couldn't make it because of its leg. Timmy called Buster over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help. As they talked, Timmy and Buster started to become good friends with the hamster. They found out his name was Henry. Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it. Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it. After Buster fixed Henry's leg he picked him up and put him on Timmy's back and they all went to the river to get some water. They all were best friends for the rest of their lives and played together.

How are Tim and Tom mixed up by others?
Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.

Which of the following sections did Tim and his mom not go through to get to the toy aisle?
Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs.

What did Lizzie pick for her mother?
There once was a beautiful princess named Lizzie who lived in a castle in the woods.  One day she went for a walk to see if any of the spring flowers had started to bloom.  Her mother's birthday was the next day.  If there were flowers blooming she would pick some for her mother. Her mother's name was Queen Alice.  As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods. She heard someone calling her name and was very happy to see her father standing near her. When she opened her eyes she also could see her brother Henry standing near her.  She could hear their dog, Daisy, rushing to meet them, too.

How many pets did Jamey look at before picking one?
Jamey really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents."Mom, Dad, can I we get a dog?"Jamey's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him. "Having a pet can be a lot of work, Jamey. When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."Jamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first. "This dog is pretty big, Jamey," his father said. "He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."  Jamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it."This dog is very noisy Jamey. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"Jamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over."Do you like the brown dog?" asked Jamey's dad."Yes!" said Jamey. "Can we get him?""Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?" asked Jamey's mom."I promise," said Jamey."In that case, I guess we have a dog!"This made Jamey very happy.

What was the farmer out doing?
Jake and Carol live next door to a banana farm. One day as they were taking a walk, Jake asked Carol if she could smell the sweet bananas. Carol said yes and that she would love it if the farmer would give them some. Jake's mouth watered at the thought of eating the golden yellow bananas. They then began walking to the farmer's barn to ask him if they could have some. When they arrived they saw a sign that said the farmer would be out until tomorrow night. He was also a singer and would be performing at a school two towns over in Orangeville. Instead of waiting for the farmer to return so that they could ask for some bananas, Jake and Carol began walking around the farm to pick their own. As he was walking, Jake tripped on a rock. As he tried to stand back up he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He could walk, but it was very painful. Carol let Jake lean on her as they walked home.

What did Kerry normally use the pail to carry?
Kerry was playing with his toy airplane in the backyard after school one day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard. He put down his toy and went over to look. He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass.Carefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog.He ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.It took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water. He watched the frog swim around for a bit, and then carried the pail around to the front of the house.It was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood. Kerry walked slowly, trying not to spill the water. The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked. Finally, he reached the creek. He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream.

Who did not fall asleep?
Amy went to the beach one day last summer. She went with her family. Her parents let her and her brother, Brian, each bring one friend. Amy invited Candace. Brian asked David. Their neighbor Eddie also went. The six of them got into Amy's dad's car and began the long trip to the beach. In the car, they sang and played games together. They soon got the beach. Everyone put on sun block and had lunch. They ate on a large, blue blanket. Amy's mother had brought the blanket. After eating, everyone found fun things to do. Amy and Candace made sand castles with Amy's father. Brian, Eddie, and David swam in the sea and played catch. Amy's mother sat in a chair and read a book. When the sun began to set, they packed everything up and began to drive home. Both Brian and Candace slept. David played a game with Amy and Eddie before Eddie fell asleep and started to drool. After they got home, everyone had dinner at Amy's and talked about how much fun they had at the beach.

What is Max?
Terry is a normal human boy who enjoys football and playing with his toys. What makes him different is that he really enjoys talking to his magical reindeer Max. One day, Terry is walking around town with Max, and as they pass by the nearby farm, the farmer who owns the land calls out to them - "Hey! You, over there!" They quickly turn around, not sure if they are the ones being called to, but seeing no one nearby, they walk over to the farmer. "What do you need, sir?" Terry asks. "I need help with the plants; they're growing faster than normal. Can you help with the potato plants?" the farmer asks. "Sure! Let's help out, Max!" Terry happily answers. They end up spending the rest of the day helping, and are paid well, both in potatoes, carrots and money, for their work. "That was fun!" Terry says to Max, as they head home.

I make faces to the penguins. Once I even gave a morning kiss to a bear! My favorite animal is the piggy. I named him Samson. He likes to eat mustard, so I toss some mustard jars into his cage every morning. I don't know why that piggy likes mustard so much.Sometimes I walk around with the Zoo King and Zoo Queen.

Why did Woofington deliver the message to Morty Roo?
Once upon a time there was a blue spider named Twinkle Toes. All spiders have to get rid of their old skin in order to grow a new, larger skin. Twinkle Toes was a very special kind of spider because his tenth new skin would be pink instead of blue. When it was time for Twinkle Toes to turn pink, he was very excited, but he was also worried. He was afraid that his best friend, an orange cat named Morty Roo, wouldn't know that the pink spider was Twinkle Toes in his new skin. He was scared that Morty Roo would mistake him for a normal spider who does not change colors. If Morty Roo saw a spider who wasn't Twinkle Toes, he would likely kill the spider and eat it. Twinkle Toes was hoping to tell Morty Roo that he would soon turn pink, but Morty Roo didn't come around to visit that day. Twinkle Toes called over Woofington, the neighbor's dog.  Twinkle Toes asked Woofington to please tell Morty Roo that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same Twinkle Toes he had always been.  Woofington normally liked to chase Morty Roo around the neighborhood. He knew he would have to be nice to Morty Roo to deliver the message and that it would be really hard. Because it was so important to Twinkle Toes, Woofington said he would deliver the message. Woofington had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs. Woofington is afraid of other bugs because they could bite him and make him sick. That evening, Twinkle Toes began growing his new, pink skin, and Woofington explained to Morty Roo that he shouldn't eat the pink spider because it was still his old friend.

Who did Sam first ask for his phone?
Sam wanted a phone, so he asked his Mom if he could have one because phones are very expensive. Sam told his Mom that he could do extra chores for money to buy one. Sam's Mom told him that a phone is very expensive, much more expensive than the toys he normally buys with his chore money. But Sam still really wanted a phone. Sam's Mom came up with an idea and told Sam to pray for one. Since she could not help him, maybe God could help him. That night Sam prayed before bed and asked if he could somehow have a phone. The next day Sam was playing bat and ball with his brother John and sister Lucy. He saw something shine from the ground. He found a phone lying there. He ran and took it to his Mom who checked the phone, and after a quick clean found the phone worked. She told Sam that someone must have lost the phone and she'll call them to tell them they have found the phone. Sam sat in the kitchen as Sam's Mom called the number in the phone. A lady called Pat answered. After telling the lady the story of Sam and his praying, the lady was so touched that she told Sam's Mom to give the phone to Sam.

What is Sam's dog's name?
Today was an important day for Sam: he was going to go to the pet store and pick out a pet to take home and live with him! Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris. Sam said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him. Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button. Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers. Sam laughed, and asked Chris to let him play with Buttons. Sam and Buttons played together in the grass outside of the store, and Sam was so happy. Buttons loved Sam, and Sam loved Buttons! Sam had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed Chris all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: Chris was so happy, too! Sam put his new friend on a leash and took Buttons home with him, and they loved each other very much.

Jim wanted to go eat some pizza. He was a giant. He had eaten a hot dog and some carrots earlier that day, but it had been a long time. He was very hungry after a hard day of playing with his kitty. But Jim had a problem, he did know where he was. While playing with his kitten, he had left his yard and wandered into the deep woods that were near his house. It was getting dark outside, and Jim the giant was scared. He was also hungry. It had been a long time since Jim had eaten. Also, it was becoming cold, and Jim had left his jacket on the ground. There was some joy from the fact that he had his kitty. His name was Bob, and was riding around on his shoulder. Still, Jim needed to find his way out of the woods fast.  It was at this time that Jim remembered that he had a flashlight in his pocket. With his flashlight, Jim could see the woods, and spot his house off in this distance. He ran home fast. Once he was home, Jim put down his kitty, and ordered a pizza. He was safe. He called his friends Steve and Adam to tell them about his big adventure, and sat down to play with his kitty Bob.

It was at this time that Jim remembered that he had a flashlight in his pocket. With his flashlight, Jim could see the woods, and spot his house off in this distance. He ran home fast. Once he was home, Jim put down his kitty, and ordered a pizza. He was safe. He called his friends Steve and Adam to tell them about his big adventure, and sat down to play with his kitty Bob.

Where did the friends go after arriving at the mall?
One sunny May afternoon, a group of teenagers ditched school and went to the mall. June volunteered to drive her friends Ben, Sasha, and Bruce. The teenagers piled into the red car and drove to the mall. When they arrived, Ben and Sasha wanted to go to the sporting goods store. However, Bruce and June wanted to go watch a movie directed by Miranda July. They split up and said they would meet up at the food area later. Three hours later, the friends got back together. Ben and Sasha wanted to leave, so they went back out to the parking lot and got in the car. When June backed out of the parking spot, she scraped the car next to her. Sasha said it was okay, but Bruce said June needed to leave a note for the driver of the other car. Just then, the other driver appeared. They called the police to get an accident report. When the police arrived, they put Ben and Sasha in handcuffs because they had been stealing. They had to volunteer every week until October.

What did Max think of the snow?
Max is a very happy cow. He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.  He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn. The hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. "What is this?" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.  "It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house. "It's so pretty!" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. "Oh! It's so chilly!" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer. "Max! What are you doing out here?" The farmer, named Bob, asked. He was loud, but not mad. "It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!" He pushed Max inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight.

What kind of dinosaur did Johnny meet?
Johnny walked toward the time machine. His adult neighbor, the scientist, had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend. He had also asked Johnny not to touch it. But it was a time machine. Johnny had to see it.The machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped. It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge.Johnny took a deep breath and stepped inside. Just a peek, he thought.There were three buttons inside. One said "past," and one said "present." Another said "space."Johnny looked at the buttons. He looked at the buttons some more. He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him. He pushed the button that said "past."There was a bright light! And bam!Johnny stepped out of the machine. It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees. The air was warm. The dirt below was muddy.He took a deep breath. "So this is the past," Johnny said.Just then he heard a bump. And another one. The ground shook. The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder.

What button did Johnny push?
Johnny walked toward the time machine. His adult neighbor, the scientist, had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend. He had also asked Johnny not to touch it. But it was a time machine. Johnny had to see it.The machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped. It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge.Johnny took a deep breath and stepped inside. Just a peek, he thought.There were three buttons inside. One said "past," and one said "present." Another said "space."Johnny looked at the buttons. He looked at the buttons some more. He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him. He pushed the button that said "past."There was a bright light! And bam!Johnny stepped out of the machine. It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees. The air was warm. The dirt below was muddy.He took a deep breath. "So this is the past," Johnny said.Just then he heard a bump. And another one. The ground shook. The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder. A tree fell.Johnny heard a roar.Two more trees fell.Suddenly, Johnny saw it: A Tyrannosaurus Rex!Johnny was so scared he couldn't breathe.The T. Rex looked up, and left, and right.

What 2 things did Michael's dad teach him about throwing a football?
As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.

What does Bobby find in his room?
Bobby got a big surprise when he came home from school one day. He found an angel in his room. His grandma had always told him angels were real. Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. Bobby said he would. Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. Bobby said he would. The angel left. They met a few more times and became good friends.

Linda is going to miss doing what with her friend Lilly?
Linda was very excited when she woke up this morning. It was finally the last day of school and she was going to get the whole summer off. She was so excited because this summer she and her family would be traveling to France. She had always wanted to visit Europe after her friend Susan visited Spain and Italy the summer before and came back knowing all sorts of funny words. She was going to get to see the Eiffel Tower, try all kinds of new food, and meet a whole bunch of new people. She was a bit worried because she didn't speak any French. She wanted to meet some of the people there and become friends. She didn't know how well that would work if she couldn't talk with them. Overall she was still quite excited. She would miss seeing her friends at home this summer. If she were in France she would miss the happy days of playing baseball with Tommy and Susan or going to movies to hide from the heat with her good friend Lilly, or getting lost wandering in the woods behind her house. Oh well, it was time to get ready for school, she would have to enjoy this last day with them before heading out on her adventure.

What happened when Jon woke up?
Jon woke up knowing that today was finally the day.  It was his birthday!  He had been waiting for this day all year long.  He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.  As he ran outside, he saw his parents weren't even awake yet!  He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.  He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.  Jon went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.  His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so Jon waited outside where the presents were.  He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!  He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.  The last box was a square shape.  If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!  He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!  His parents had put it in a box so it wouldn't be clear.  He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.  His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time. There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but Jon was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!

He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!  His parents had put it in a box so it wouldn't be clear.  He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.  His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time. There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but Jon was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!

How many gifts did Jon get?
Jon woke up knowing that today was finally the day.  It was his birthday!  He had been waiting for this day all year long.  He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.  As he ran outside, he saw his parents weren't even awake yet!  He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.  He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.  Jon went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.  His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so Jon waited outside where the presents were.  He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!

What is the boy's favorite TV shows?
Jimmy loved watching television. He would wake up and watch Cartoons on Cartoon Network. His favorite cartoon was Scooby Doo. After his mom picked him up at the bus stop, he would go home and watch the Flintstones. One day, his mom told him he was not allowed to watch cartoons after school.  He was very sad. She told him he had to go outside to play. He walked into the backyard. Fido was running around. He started to chase him. He picked up a ball and threw it. Fido ran after it and brought it back. Jimmy laughed. He chased after Fido and scratched his back. Maybe being outside wasn't so bad after all! He played with Fido for another hour until his mom called him inside. It was dinner time. Dinner was fried chicken and mashed potatoes-his favorite. He was happy his mom made him go outside. He would go outside every day after school now!

What time was Chris coming over?
Nick was so happy to finally meet his cousin. Just this morning he found out what a cousin is. A cousin is somebody who has the same grandmother and grandfather as you. He didn't even know he had a cousin and now they were going to play together. This was going to be a great day. Right after he ate lunch and had a quick piece of candy for snack he pulled out the letter that his cousin Chris wrote to him. He read it over and over again.

What class did Jill prefer?
Jill was a normal student. However, she was barely passing her classes this year. Her finals were coming up in a few weeks and Jill was very nervous about her Math test. She was never very good at Math. Her brother always teased her because he was great at Math, History, and Science, but she preferred Art. To raise her grades, Jill spent the week before finals studying every day in the school library. On the last day before the test, Jill walked in and was ready to work hard like she had every day that week. Except this time she looked over and saw her best friend, Michelle, walking up to her. Michelle greeted Jill and told her that she wants to help her study for the Math test. The two girls spend the rest of the afternoon looking over their class notes. By the end of the day, Jill finally felt ready. She left and walked back to her house. That night Jill made sure to get lots of sleep. She awoke early and had a filling breakfast before making her way to school. Her teacher, Mr. Matthews, handed out the Math tests and she began to work. She felt like she did a really good job, but she was scared, too. Jill had to wait until tomorrow to see how she did. The next day she hurried back to class. Jill walked in and grabbed her test from the stack of papers. She let out a yell. Jill had failed. She turned to her friend Michelle and started to cry. She was so upset.

Who gave Bobby his favorite blanket?
Bobby was a little barn mouse and loved to sleep on a blanket. Every day in the morning, Bobby would wake up and fold his little blue blanket that he slept on. Bobby's uncle Arthur got the blanket for Bobby from in the big house. Bobby loved this blanket more than any other thing he had. Bobby had a lot of neat stuff. He had a penny, a safety pin and an earring. He found all of these when he would walk through the forest in the afternoon. Bobby's uncle Arthur would always take walks with him through the forest, to make sure that Bobby didn't get in any trouble. Bobby had to be careful that people didn't see him, because the people didn't like mice. Bobby didn't understand, because people liked other animals, but would scream if they saw a mouse. They didn't scream if they saw a dog, cat or chicken. Bobby thought the dogs were the scariest and people might rather scream when they saw dogs and not mice.

Why did Betsy stop playing with Twinkles to go home?
There was once a little fairy named Twinkles who lived in an old willow tree. The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, "Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.""Do not worry," said Twinkles. "I am going to wait here for you until you get back."With that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. "Hmm," thought Twinkles, "I wonder where Betsy went off to." Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.Soon, she heard a voice calling from down below. "Help me! I'm stuck!" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. "Don't worry, I am coming to save you!" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free."Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.""No problem," said Twinkles. "That's what friends are for."

What time did Eric have to be home?
"Be home by dinnertime", Eric's mother said as he left for school that morning. Eric was excited. Today was show and tell, and he planned to do his magic tricks for the whole class.

He showed the class his that the hat was empty, then he reached inside, into the secret space where the hamster was hidden. The hamster was gone. He heard a scream.

What did the family not eat at the park for lunch?
A family of four went to the zoo today.  The animal zoo they were going to had a bunch of different kinds of animals!  The kids were so excited to go that they had almost forgot to bring their camera.  They arrived to the zoo and the first thing they saw were the flamingos!  They were so pretty and pink.  They all stood around very silently and looked at the people.  The next animal they saw were the lions.  They were so scary looking that the kids were scared to walk close to the fence. After the lions were the giraffes.  They were so tall, the kids had to lean all the way back to see them.  The kids were hungry so they went to go eat lunch.  The family had a bunch of food such as pizza, burgers, chicken fingers, and fries. After lunch, they went to see the monkeys.  They were so loud and smelly.  Some of the monkeys went right up to the glass to look at the people.  The family took a break after seeing the monkeys as they were tired from all the walking.  The park was so big that they had so many more animals to see!  Their feet started hurting, so the family went to see a few more animals.  They went home after a really fun day at the zoo.  They had seen a lot of animals they never would have seen outside of the zoo.  They loved the zoo so much they wanted to go back next week!  The parents said they would come back soon to see how the animals were doing.

What was the weather like that day?
Joe got a new bicycle as a gift from one of his friends. He wanted to ride it so he looked outside his window to check the weather. There was lots of daylight and it was bright and sunny. The sky was clear and there was only a little bit of wind. He was excited that the weather was good because it meant that he can go and ride his bicycle. He took his bicycle down the stairway and told his parents that he wanted to go ride his bicycle for a little bit. After his parents said OK, he put on his helmet and went outside with his bicycle to ride it around the block. It was very fun and Joe had a great time riding his bicycle.

Kramer the kitten loved to hunt for mice. He was black with white boots. Kramer was still a baby, so he liked to play all night long and sleep during the day. His favorite toy is a little fake squeaky mouse. One day, Kramer was waking up from a long nap. He saw a little mouse out of the corner of his eye. He jumped up and began to chase him around the room. He ran and ran until the mouse went into a little hole in the wall. Mary the mouse was so scared.

Why did Billy want to eat the bunny?
Billy was a monster. He was born in Monster Town, where he learned how to be a monster and how to do monster things. One day Billy was very hungry. There are no stores in Monster Town, so Billy had to find his own food. He saw some bugs but he did not want to eat those because bugs are gross and taste bad. Then he saw a bunny and thought it would be a good thing to eat. Bunnies are very delicious. Monsters eat all sorts of things that humans do not eat. Billy chased the bunny into a field. Soon he could not find it any more. Bill was sad. He was still hungry. But then he saw a house. He sneaked towards it and looked inside. No one was home. He crawled through an open window and saw a funny looking box. He opened it and saw many little pebbles inside of all different colors. He was about to eat them when a small human child appeared out of nowhere and took the box out of his hands. Silly Billy, Trix are for kids.

Why did the zoo have to close down?
There once was a zoo worker named Charlie.  He really liked his job that allowed his to meet new people every day and take care of zoo animals.  One day, Charlie showed up at the zoo that he worked at and saw that a turtle had escaped!  He quickly picked up the radio and told all of the other workers to look out for the missing Turtle named Brian.  Because of this, the zoo had to close down for the whole day!  They were trying so hard, but still could not find any clue to where the turtle went.  Finally, a girl named Samantha went on the radio and said that she found Brian eating lettuce in the Polar Bear cage.  She also told everyone that the Polar Bears were protecting Brian!  For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get Brian out of the cage without getting hurt themselves.  Charlie finally had an idea.  He was going to take a stuffed turtle from the gift shop, sneak into the cage, put the Polar Bears to sleep for a little bit, and then place the stuffed turtle where Brian was eating his lettuce.  Charlie's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and weren't happy!  They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!  Samantha went to find some fish to make them happy again as Charlie told Brian the turtle to never run off again.

Why did the mother take the dog outside?
On a Monday, a mother was in the kitchen cooking ham for the family.  She was in quite the hurry because she had to pick the kids up from school.  Without knowing, she stuck a spoon in the ham and put the ham in the oven.  She wasn't paying attention because of being in a hurry and also because the dog was playing with a ball.  The ball flew past her head as she had finished putting the ham in the oven.  She yelled at the dog and made him play with the ball outside.  She saw clouds in the sky as she let the dog out.

What did Ogthar do after forgetting about his shoes?
There was once a magical lightning wand that contained special powers. When held by a human, it is believed to have given the human special powers that would allow them to take over the skies and the sea. Because of its dangerous power, a king named Ogthar wanted to hide the wand on a planet where no one could find it. Before Ogthar went out to hide his wand, he had to tie his shoelaces. Instead of tying them with his hands, he waved the wand to make it do it for him. Instead of tying his shoes, the wind and sky blew the shoes right off of Ogthar. Ogthar cried and cried because he no longer had shoes. After 17 days of crying, Ogthar saw that his life was not terrible without shoes, because he still had a magical wand. Ogthar then forgot about his shoes and instead made a magical land called "Wind and Sky Land" for children to gather and play in the fun wind and seas. Ogthar forgot about his shoes after a couple of years and even went on to go to school and get smarter. Ogthar is now a fireman and is glad that he never hid the wand. He now can never die and whenever he thinks of his shoes, he says to himself "Stop it!"

Where were two of the adventurers from?
Once there was a group of adventurers who went on an adventure in a place named Hyperion where there was a lot of snow. Their names were Thor, Bravos, and Pierre. Thor and Bravos were from Norway, but Pierre was from Paris, France. Because of where he was from, he wasn't used to the cold. To stay warm, Pierre wore three jackets. One day during their adventure the men saw a strange cave. Thor and Bravos wanted to go inside, but Pierre was afraid. He had heard that a horrible bug monster named Vlastos lived in the caves of Hyperion. Thor and Bravos told him that was only a fairy tale. They told him the only thing he really needed to worry about was hitting his head on a rock in the cave. Finally they got Pierre to go into the cave. Inside there were lots of tunnels. They chose the middle tunnel. The tunnel went down into the earth. After a long time it ended. The men were in a huge room. There were beautiful ice shapes on the walls.

He had heard that a horrible bug monster named Vlastos lived in the caves of Hyperion. Thor and Bravos told him that was only a fairy tale. They told him the only thing he really needed to worry about was hitting his head on a rock in the cave. Finally they got Pierre to go into the cave. Inside there were lots of tunnels. They chose the middle tunnel. The tunnel went down into the earth. After a long time it ended. The men were in a huge room. There were beautiful ice shapes on the walls.

Where did John find the blue flowers?
Once upon a time there were four children.  Each of the children had a favorite color.  John's favorite color was blue.  Jack's favorite color was red.  Jenny's favorite color was purple and Alice's favorite color was yellow.  They walked along the road one day and stopped to pick flowers for their mother.  Jack picked a handful of red flowers.  "Mom is going to love these!" he said.  Jenny picked a handful of purple flowers.  "These are perfect for mother," She thought.  Alice picked two handfuls of yellow flowers.  "Yellow flowers are so pretty for mom's kitchen," she said.  John looked and looked, but couldn't find any blue flowers.  He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers.  He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers. He was very sad.  They walked along the road toward home to give their flowers to their mother.  John walked very slowly and hung his head because he didn't have any flowers to give his mother.  As they neared their home, John saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence.  He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters.  When they got home they gave their mother all the flowers they had picked.  She thanked them and put them on her kitchen table.  "I have the most thoughtful children in the world," She said.

What was the dad's favorite food?
There was once a family called the McAllisters. There was a dad, John McAllister, a mom, Amy McAllister, and their two twins, Ally and Jonah McAllister. This family was a family family, but when it came time to eat dinner, they sometimes argued. This is because different people liked different meals. John liked chicken most of all, and Amy liked vegetables. The twins, Ally and Jonah, preferred hotdogs, but Ally preferred ketchup, and Jonah preferred mustard. When it came to every day dinners, they took turns eating what each person liked. However, when it came to special meals like thanksgiving, it was difficult for the family to choose what to have. There would be frequent fights between all of them on what they would eat. Finally, they all had the answer. They would invite their grandpa over, because their grandpa was a great cook and could make everyone's favorite food, including chicken, vegetables, and hotdogs. On Thanksgiving, everyone was happy.

Which of the boys hurt his knee, and from what?
Mark, Matthew, Zach and John love to play Football. They did not really care for baseball, basketball or soccer much. They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game. After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.

Where did we do after breakfast?
One morning, Daddy, Ethan, and I went out shopping for Mother's day gifts.  First we went to buy some flowers.  I found a nice big bunch of pink roses that were very pretty.  Then we went and bought a card.  There were a lot to choose from, some of them had pictures of kids and some of them had pictures of animals.  Daddy wanted to get one with a kid hugging his mommy but Ethan wanted the one with a cat on it, and I wanted the one with a dog on it.  We ended up getting all three.  Then we went to buy ingredients so we could cook breakfast.  On Mother's day I helped Daddy make breakfast.  We made chocolate pancakes and eggs.  It was very messy but a lot of fun.  Mommy loved getting breakfast in bed and she liked the flowers and cards.  We also went out to go to the park after breakfast.  It was a beautiful day and a lot of fun.

What sort of card did I choose to get?
One morning, Daddy, Ethan, and I went out shopping for Mother's day gifts.  First we went to buy some flowers.  I found a nice big bunch of pink roses that were very pretty.  Then we went and bought a card.  There were a lot to choose from, some of them had pictures of kids and some of them had pictures of animals.  Daddy wanted to get one with a kid hugging his mommy but Ethan wanted the one with a cat on it, and I wanted the one with a dog on it.  We ended up getting all three.  Then we went to buy ingredients so we could cook breakfast.  On Mother's day I helped Daddy make breakfast.  We made chocolate pancakes and eggs.  It was very messy but a lot of fun.  Mommy loved getting breakfast in bed and she liked the flowers and cards.  We also went out to go to the park after breakfast.  It was a beautiful day and a lot of fun.

Who else did Sam buy a soda for?
Sam was outside playing. It was very hot out and he got really thirsty. He saw that Mr. Brown was setting up a table with sodas and snacks down the street. Sam was very excited because this would solve his problem. He checked his pockets. They were empty. Where did his money go? This was a problem. In order to get a soda and snack he would need money. Sam ran home as fast as he could. He was in a rush. He passed by Jim as he was running. He asked Sam why he was running. "No time," Sam Said. When he got inside the house Sam was very happy. His money was on his dresser in his bedroom. Thank goodness. He had enough money to get a soda. Sam ran back outside, but this time he slowed down when he saw Jim. He told Jim to come with him to Mr. Brown's table. He had enough money to buy them both a soda.

why was his mom upset?
It was Saturday and it was nice outside. I did not have school and my mom did not have work. When I woke up we ate breakfast and got ready for the day. My mom started to clean up the house so I went up to my room to play with my toys. My mom came upstairs and told me, "If you clean up your room there is a great surprise in it for you." I was very excited about what the surprise was but not very excited to clean my room. My mom left and closed the door. I looked around and saw how messy my room was. And I really did not want to clean it. So what I did was pick up all my stuff in my room and put it all in my closet. It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise. She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did. She was not happy about it. She said, "You either do it right, or Ill do it right and you won't get a surprise." That was enough to make me clean my room right. Finally, my mom told me the surprise when I was all finished. She told me we were going out to the park! But by the time we got there, I could only play for a little bit before it started getting dark. I wished I would have cleaned my room right the first time so I had more time at the park.

What did everyone eat at the party?
Today is the big day, today is Saturday and it is my birthday party.  I turned 7 on Thursday, but I wanted my party on the weekend.  All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could. I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.  After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.  Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.  My birthday party was the best day of my life.

How many trips did he make to the store?
Jim wanted to make a fun meal one day. After thinking about it for a long time, he chose to make a chicken dish. Jim made a trip to the store to collect all of the different things he would need to make this meal. He drove his blue truck to the store. On the way he passed a green car, a red van, and a yellow bus. When he got to the store, he met his friends Bob & Mark. He asked if they had seen his friend Joe, but they said no. At the store, Jim bought two pieces of chicken, tomato sauce, cheese, and bread. He drove back to the house, but he saw that something was missing. He had forgotten to grab the bag with the bread in it. He drove back to the store, apologized to the clerk, and grabbed his bag with the bread inside. When he got home, he began to get the food ready. It took him an hour to get the chicken ready to cook and the oven heated up. After that, it took him another hour to cook the food. He had to wait another hour after it was done cooking for his dinner guests to arrive. When they finally arrived, everyone told Jim how wonderful the food tasted, and everyone at the table asked for seconds. Jim smiled, glad that everyone loved this meal that he had worked so hard to make.

"Bill is going to build a fort in my backyard today, and I get to help," Faith said. "Would you like to come over and help too?"Becca thought about what she had to do that day. Her mother had told her she needed to get her chores done before she could play at Faith's house. "First, I have to clean my room," Becca told Faith. "Maybe I can help you," Faith said. "I helped Sam clean his room once.""Sure!" Becca answered.The girls went to Becca's room and started to pick up toys and clothes. "Maybe I need to clean under the bed," Becca said. Under the bed, she found a library book she had been missing. Faith finished putting all of the clothes into the hamper."Thanks for the help!" Becca said. "Now I can go with you.""I hope we don't have to clean my room, too!" said Faith.

What happened to John's friend
John was stuck in the middle of the ocean after his boat crashed and sank. He was worried about his friend who'd been in the boat with him. He knew that his friend has his life jacket on, so he tried not to worry too much about him. John was in a small box that fell out of the boat and kept him out of the water, floating. John had never been to sea before and one would wonder if he would ever after such a scary thing that happened to him. He sat in the box for days with no food or water, in and out of sleep. Three days later he woke up and saw land. Finally a beach was in sight, John could go home.

What are the names of Kim's brothers?
Kim's birthday was the next day. Every year on her birthday, her mother would make her favorite meal, and they would give Kim her birthday presents. Kim wanted spaghetti for dinner, and a special dollhouse as her present. On the morning of her birthday, Kim's brother Jamie woke her up by pretending to be a monster and making her scream. She was tired for the rest of the day because she could not go back to sleep. Her father thought it was funny and didn't yell at Jamie for teasing his sister. Kim's other brother, Danny, came back home for her birthday, and was helping Jamie tease her. They hid behind the soda and made funny noises. They hid her shoes. They switched where her toys were and made her think she had lost them. By the time dinner was ready, Kim was upset. Then it appeared that her mother had not made the meal she had hoped to have after all. Just as Kim was about to start crying and leave the table, her brothers surprised her with a huge box. Excited, Kim tore open the box to see that it was the dollhouse she wanted. Her mother showed her she had made spaghetti like Kim wanted. Jamie said he was sorry for scaring her, and she, Jamie, and Danny hugged.

I am behind you."Watermelon turned around.  Off in the distance, it saw the rock."But Rock, you are so far away!  Can you come closer?""No, I can't.  I am a rock.  I am big and flat and heavy.

I spent last weekend with my grandma and grandpa. I love them very much! I always look forward to visiting them! They always do fun things with me. Last weekend, we went to the zoo together. I saw a great big elephant. It had a long nose. My grandpa and I played a game to see who could be the most like an elephant. We stomped around a lot and made trumpeting noises. I won! Grandma looked on and laughed. I saw a monkeys too! The monkeys swung through the trees. They even made monkey noises! Grandma wanted to take a picture of me with the monkeys, but I was too busy pretending I was monkey to stand still. After we left the zoo, I went home. We had dinner together. Then, my grandma read me a story and tucked me into bed. I had a great time with my grandparents. I love them a lot. I always look forward to visiting them.

She then helped Chris get to the car. The next day, Rick asked Chris if he was okay from the fall at the playground. Chris said he was okay and wanted to go play at the playground again soon.

How old was Sarah when she broke the piggy bank?
I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry.My mother came in at the sound of the crash. "I'm so, so sorry!" I cried. "I broke the bank! I broke the family bank!""What, Sarah?" my mother asked, kneeling next to me on the floor. "The what?""The bank! Aunt Tracy said it was in the family for years!""What, this? We got it for you at a garage sale when you were two. It was fifty cents."

Who went to the store?
Kyle was excited. So excited that he ate and got dressed before his dad even woke up. Today he was going to the store to spend the money his grandma had sent him for his birthday. When Dad was finally ready to go, Kyle hurried to the car. Today was extra special because none of his sisters were going with them. His older sister Sandy was visiting her best friend. His younger sister Sarah was going to a movie with their mom. So today was a special day, only Kyle and Dad being guys together.Once they reached the store, Kyle walked slowly down each aisle, looking at all the toys and trying to find the best one. Purple superheroes, colorful games, and a bright blue ball all caught his eye, but Kyle kept looking. Finally he saw it, hiding on the bottom shelf. The most perfect toy- a shiny, white jeep. Kyle rushed to pick it up and show it to his dad. His dad thought the jeep was a great toy. And Kyle had enough money to buy it. The clerk took Kyle's money and placed the perfect car into a bag for the boy. As they drove home, Kyle looked into the bag at his dream toy several times, to make sure it was real. And all afternoon he pretended to drive his jeep around the house. This had been the best day ever!

How many hops until the rabbit bounced higher?
A rabbit was hopping around, following all the smells he could smell. He had a great nose, smelling carrots, bushes, flowers, and other animals. He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream. Rabbits don't like ice cream, so he moved to the flowers faster. And he didn't really like to snack on melons either. He saw friends, the duckling and the mother duck, but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers. He could smell the flowers from a long way away. He kept hopping to reach them, faster and faster. One hop, two hops, three hops. On his third hop he always bounced a little higher. He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster. The flowers were in sight. He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before. A wonderful smell at last.

Where was Corky going when he passed June's house?
Corky walked to the store to buy some milk, like he does every Tuesday. On his way, he passed the red house where John lives, the green house where June lives, the white house where Barack lives, the blue hat store, and the orange house where Jessie lives. He finally reached the store at 5 o'clock. Corky thought about buying some other things too. He looked at the potato chips, but didn't like the flavors they had left. All of the normal flavored ones were gone. He never liked hard candy, so he ignored those. He saw the apples, but didn't need one because he had apples at home. So he picked out some cookies instead. Corky thought he'd eat them on his way home. He waited in line until it was his turn, and then paid Abe the cashier. Abe gave him his change and wished him a good day.On his way home, Corky ate his cookies. He had hoped to buy peanut butter cookies, but the store never has those. Instead, he bought sugar cookies. He liked them very much too, so he wasn't at all upset. When he got home, he poured a glass of milk and finished his cookies.

What was Billy's favorite ice cream flavor?
Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her offOnce Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'

Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her offOnce Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'

What kind of animal is Juno?
Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.

What time of day was it when Timmy got bored?
His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at 12 o'clock. Lunchtime had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat. Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.  Timmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.  He looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil. Timmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat. He folded the paper into a mighty ship.   In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea. Danger was all around. The imaginary men on his paper boat were facing the storm bravely and sailed into safety as he was falling asleep.

What did the cat do with the tuna juice?
The cat woke up from its nap under the couch. Poking his head out from under the couch, there were no dogs there. He walked out from under the couch and stretched out his paws along the hard wood floor. Far outside there was some barking from the dogs, but he was safe from them for now. The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen. A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids. When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor. The cat slowly walked up to the can and saw some juice inside. He licked up the yummy tuna juice and was sad when it was all gone. The woman brought the tuna sandwiches over to her sons at the table, then she opened the back door to let the dogs in. The cat's fur stood on end as the dogs came running after him.

Who opened the back door?
Once upon a time, there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm. He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night. On cold winter days, he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn, getting some extra warmth. One winter day, the mouse was very cold, but needed something to eat. He left the hay stack, and ran past the lamp. He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm. He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer. The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside, so the mouse was all alone. He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred. Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor. The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere! The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him. He heard the back door open again, and hid under the oven. It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking. Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread, cake, or cookies. The mouse stayed there to warm up, then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night.

Why did they go home?
The kids were playing outside. They were drawing with chalk. They drew many things with the chalk. One of those things was a star. There was nothing else for them to do because it was the weekend. Then they stopped drawing with the chalk a little later. They did not want to go on because they were tired. They walked a little then started to splash by the lake that was nearby instead. They thought it was a good idea because it was a hot day. They played for hours.  They were making a lot of noise and laughing and talking. They went home. They did this because they were very tired. They all ate some bread. They were now quiet. They couldn't have anything else to eat until their mother called them for dinner. They waited and did not say a word. They were resting. Soon it would be time for the family meal.

Who was eating a cracker in the kitchen?
Once there was a fish who had lived his whole life in his bowl. He often got bored and wished to see the rest of the world, but because he was a fish, he couldn't leave the water. So one day he made a special fish suit that would allow him to walk on land and breathe air like humans. He knew this would change his life, and make him rich, but first he would have to test it out.He put the suit on and leaped from the bowl that until now had been his whole world. The suit worked! Now he could go where he wanted.First he went to the kitchen of the house. There he saw a parrot eating a cracker. Second he went outside to the yard. He saw squirrels there running around looking for food. Third he went to the barn in the field. He saw a mommy cow. She was teaching her calf how to run.Finally he went to forest where he saw more trees than he had ever seen in his whole life.But after all this he was tired, and made up his mind to go back to his home in the bowl. It was a lot of work trying to see the world. He took off the special suit and splashed back into the water. His suit had passed the test and he was very happy, but he had made up his mind that his bowl was the place for him.

What animals did doggy see on his ride?
There once was a doggy named Jack that was really bored.  One day he was sitting on the sofa he thought to himself, "Maybe I'll go for a ride." The dog put on his shoes and hat and walked out of the door.  He began riding down the street and he saw a lot of funny things.  He saw a pumpkin name Sue using toothpaste, a cat name Walt watching a movie and a bear name Phil cooking on a grill. On his drive back home he saw a rat name Randy, and a lion name Leo riding a bike. When the doggy got back home he wanted to write a book about all of the things that he saw.  He went into his office and gathered the pen and paper, sat down and began writing.  After hours of writing he felt that his leg was hurting from being bent under the table so long. He wrote his last sentence and got up to walk off the pain.

Where was Sam's granddad's boat?
Sam's granddad was going to take Sam and his two brothers, James and Evan on vacation.  They could choose to go to the lake or the beach.  If they chose the lake, they would get to go on their granddad's boat.  If they chose the beach, there would be sand to dig in.  All three boys began to clap and cheer for the beach!  The boys left their house in their granddad's van to drive to the beach.  They drove by their school on the way.  The boys were glad to be out for the summer.  On the road, the boys played a game.  Whoever counted the most big trucks would be the winner.  James counted one hundred and five trucks.  This was more than Sam or Evan counted.  Evan pointed out the window at a man dressed all in black riding a black motorcycle.  The man had a long beard.  When they got to the beach, their granddad told them to put on sunscreen so they would not get sun burned. The boys grabbed their pails and shovels and ran down on to the sand near the water.  Their granddad brought a chair to sit on and a large umbrella to give him shade.  He also brought some noodles for the boys to float on if they went into the water.  Sam found a piece of wood washed up on the beach.  He used it make a bridge over large hole that the boys had dug.

When they got to the beach, their granddad told them to put on sunscreen so they would not get sun burned. The boys grabbed their pails and shovels and ran down on to the sand near the water.  Their granddad brought a chair to sit on and a large umbrella to give him shade.  He also brought some noodles for the boys to float on if they went into the water.  Sam found a piece of wood washed up on the beach.  He used it make a bridge over large hole that the boys had dug.

Who won the counting trucks game?
Sam's granddad was going to take Sam and his two brothers, James and Evan on vacation.  They could choose to go to the lake or the beach.  If they chose the lake, they would get to go on their granddad's boat.  If they chose the beach, there would be sand to dig in.  All three boys began to clap and cheer for the beach!  The boys left their house in their granddad's van to drive to the beach.  They drove by their school on the way.  The boys were glad to be out for the summer.  On the road, the boys played a game.

What did Pam and Ron do once they returned to the front of the store?
On the third day of November, Ron and Pam went to the store. They wanted to get some food for a new recipe. It was late in the afternoon, but they wanted to eat the food soon at dinner. To save time they split the list in half. Ron was to get the pasta and tomato sauce, and Pam was to get the vegetables and juice. They went their separate ways in the store, and made plans to meet in the checkout line in half an hour.  On her way to the fruit and vegetable section, Pam ran into her friend Tom. Tom had bought a pet bunny for his friend and wanted to buy it some food. He asked Pam what he needs to feed the bunny. Pam told him lettuce and carrots, so he put 5 heads of lettuce in his basket along with one bag of carrots. Tom said goodbye to Pam and went to the front of the store to buy his vegetables. Now it was time for Pam to pick out the vegetables she would buy for dinner. She wanted to make a salad, so she bought spinach, 2 big red tomatoes, a box of mushrooms, and 3 cucumbers. Pam then went to where they kept the juice and grabbed a big bottle of lemonade.Pam went to the front of the store and met Ron. They handed their items to the sales clerk so that they could buy them. The total cost of the food was 20 dollars. As a gift to Pam, Ron paid for the food and said happy birthday. As a gift he would be cooking her dinner.

Which food could Ashley imagine eating?
Ashley woke up bright and early on Friday morning during summer.  Her birthday was only a day away, and her parents had promised her a trip to the fair as her present the next day!  She thought it was going to be quite a treat.  She skipped down the stairs to see her mom making a chocolate cake on the stove.  "You run along outside to go play with your friends," her mom told her, "I can get everything ready for your special lunch on my own."  When Ashley made it outside, she found her friend Katherine playing in the dirt.  When Ashley came closer, she saw that in the dirt were a bunch of insects.  Katherine loved finding and collecting different ones for her insect collection.  Ashley thought it was kind of gross personally, but she sat down next her anyways."Happy birthday, Ashley," Katherine yelled when she saw her best friend."Thank you," Ashley answered, "Do you want to go up to the playground until it's time for lunchtime?  Mom says you're invited to come by the way."Katherine nodded, and the two spent a fun morning playing on the playground.  Once lunchtime came, the two walked back to Ashley's house.  She could picture how many of her favorite foods her mom had most likely made, and she could almost taste the spaghetti on her tongue.  Lunch was ready when they arrived, and it was delicious!  The chocolate cake her mom made was an extra special treat.  She couldn't wait to go to the fair tomorrow!

How do the fish make me feel?
I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel. The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy. One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot. That cut hurt and made me sad. The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut. Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals. His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel.

Why did grandpa give the boy a pea?
There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle.  He would wiggle everywhere he went. He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food.  He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house. He could wiggle his right knee when he walked, and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle.One day, his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle.  His grandpa was old and liked to cough.  He had a long beard that was grey at the top. He was tired of watching the boy wiggle, and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much. So, his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea. He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle. The boy started roaring with laughter. He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle.  The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist.The boy tried to wiggle, but he couldn't wiggle at all. All he could do was walk straight. That was no fun. What good was a boy if he couldn't wiggle when he wanted?  The grandpa coughed and smiled. He enjoyed watching the boy not wiggle any more.

What did the children want to make?
When I was a little girl I lived in a place with no winter. It was always warm there. It never got cold. It never snowed. Sometimes it rained. Sometimes there was wind. But there was no snow on the trees or on the ground. There was no snow falling on our heads. There was no snow to make a snowman. My teacher's name was Mrs. Scott. One day in December, Mrs. Scott told us that we were going to make a snowman. We were excited! We wanted to see a snowman. We knew how a snowman looked. We knew a snowman was made of three snowballs. A snowman had to have a carrot nose and black eyes and buttons. A snowman had a hat and a scarf. We knew all these things. Mrs. Scott asked us to bring everything we needed to our classroom to make a snowman. Jimmy said, "I can bring the hat and the scarf." Anita said, "I can bring a carrot for the nose." Selma said, "I can cut out some black circles for the eyes and the buttons." Ricky asked, "But who can bring the snow?" Mrs. Scott said, "I know what to do."The next day all the children brought the things for the snowman. We did not know where Mrs. Scott would get the snow. Then she showed us. Our snowman is made of three bushes! Three bushes painted white! We put all the things on the bushes and it looked like a real snowman.

Who brought all the things to make the snowman?
When I was a little girl I lived in a place with no winter. It was always warm there. It never got cold. It never snowed. Sometimes it rained. Sometimes there was wind. But there was no snow on the trees or on the ground. There was no snow falling on our heads. There was no snow to make a snowman. My teacher's name was Mrs. Scott. One day in December, Mrs. Scott told us that we were going to make a snowman. We were excited! We wanted to see a snowman. We knew how a snowman looked. We knew a snowman was made of three snowballs. A snowman had to have a carrot nose and black eyes and buttons. A snowman had a hat and a scarf. We knew all these things. Mrs. Scott asked us to bring everything we needed to our classroom to make a snowman. Jimmy said, "I can bring the hat and the scarf." Anita said, "I can bring a carrot for the nose." Selma said, "I can cut out some black circles for the eyes and the buttons." Ricky asked, "But who can bring the snow?" Mrs. Scott said, "I know what to do."The next day all the children brought the things for the snowman. We did not know where Mrs. Scott would get the snow. Then she showed us. Our snowman is made of three bushes! Three bushes painted white! We put all the things on the bushes and it looked like a real snowman.

Who did the lion first go talk to?
There once was a lion who did not roar, but instead he said meow. The lion was sad, because he could not roar like his other lion friends. The lion went to talk to his family. He first went to talk to his brother, but his brother was not home. Then he went to talk to his dad, but his dad was not home either. Luckily, the lion's sister was home. He asked his sister why he thought he could not roar. His sister said they need to go talk to their friend the squirrel. The squirrel lived in a tree with a nice door mat outside. The squirrel said to the lion if he wanted to start to roar instead of meow, then he need to run faster than the other lion's. So the next day, the lion played a game, in which he ran faster than all the other lions. Now, the lion roars and doesn't meow.

Who made a mistake with the dessert recipe?
Paul worked as a cook in a restaurant. For Valentine's Day, he made chocolate desserts. He tripled the recipe to feed all the people. He separated the eggs and measured the sugar. Then he melted the chocolate. He mixed the egg whites until they made a thick foam. He mixed the egg yolks with the sugar. But as he was ready to mix everything, his boss asked him to do a different job. Paul chopped some vegetables. When he came back, Greg had taken over his work and made a mistake. The mix was much too thin. It looked like chocolate soup. It wouldn't rise at all. Luckily Paul was ready. He had practiced the dessert recipe before. It looked like it didn't have enough egg whites. Paul separated more eggs and mixed the egg whites. He added the extra egg whites to the mix. His addition worked. The desserts rose high in the oven. He saved the day!

What made everything twinkle?
Hannah was so sad! If she had one wish, it would be that she was well enough to go outside and play. The storm last night had brought a lot of snow, she could see it through the window. The snow caused everything to twinkle and shine, like it was colored with a marker made of glitter. What a way to start Christmas break, with the flu making her stuck on the sofa under a blanket. Hannah's brother was getting ready to go outside and enjoy the snow. He put on his jacket and put her hat on his head. He had to wiggle his gloves out of his pocket, but he was nice and warm. From the sofa, Hannah watched her brother play in the snow with his friends and throw snowballs. Her brother tossed a stone at the pond and it broke through the ice with a splash.

When was the kitty put back out?
The kitty did not want to freeze, so it found a place to stay warm in a trashcan near a bush. The kitty had been left outside in the rain, but some friendly people thought that they would let it in when they found it in the trashcan outside. They gave the kitty some water to sip, and food to eat. When the phone would ring, the kitty would run and hide. The kitty would hide in the bathroom. Sometimes, the kitty would take its food into the bedroom and eat it there. The kitty's claws were so sharp that they ended up cutting everything that it scratched.

What happened when the game started?
Jason lay in his bed after a night of no sleep.  He was too excited for today.  There was a football game that he was going to play with his friends.  It would be him, Jack, James, and John competing with David, Ruth, Parsons, and Mike.  David, Rush, Parsons, and Mike were much bigger than them, and were big bullies at school. When Jason got up, he had the choice to eat cereal, candy, chocolate milk, or pizza.  He chose to eat cereal because he thought that eating something good for you would make him play better.   They were going to play at the school, but the school was closed.  They then went to the park, and got their teams set up.  Jason's team got the ball first and they scored!  David's team got the ball next, but they also scored.  Unfortunately, it started raining.  Everyone was getting wet, and people were starting to get angry.  A fight soon broke out, and they all started fighting with each other.  Eventually, Jason yelled for everyone to stop.  They all stopped and chose to eat pizza together and forgive each other.  Jason then went home bruised and dirty, and his parents grounded him for getting into a fight.

What is the narrator dressed up as?
It's finally the weekend of Halloween and I get to dress up in my lion costume.  Halloween is my favorite holiday because I really like candy and love dressing up.  Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion.  My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything.  He is only 3 years old so I guess that is okay.  His name is Todd and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I don't think he knows much about any of them.  My dad loves Christmas and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving.  But I love Halloween.   We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat.  While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner.  She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get.  I can't wait to go to my friend Kevin's house.  His parents give the best candy and give me extra since Kevin is my friend.  I think Kevin said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I don't remember.  I don't think pirates are very cool, but I didn't tell Kevin that.  I think I hear my dad coming up the stairs.  Tonight is going to be the best Halloween ever.

He also hated tying his shoes and matching his socks. These were all things Truman didn't like doing.  So when the Grizzly bear king held a town meeting to pass out all the shirts, Truman stole the microphone and sang a song to express his feelings: "I won't wear those shirts you bear bosses, I won't wear my socks. I have all the fur I need, don't put me in a shirt box. I want to scratch the ground with my claws, and feel the wild wind; If you all make me wear, then my darlings as a bear, I think I'll smash you with my paws, and chew off all your skins."

Joe was a young boy who was excited for his first day of school.  He jumped out of bed with a big smile on his face, ready for school.  He looked in the mirror as he put on his white shirt and blue jeans, and ran down the stairs to get breakfast.  His breakfast was waffles with syrup and eggs.  His favorite breakfasts are pancakes and cereal, but the waffles were good.  After eating all his food, he grabbed his lunch and ran out the door towards the yellow school bus.  He arrived at the bus stop and waited for the bus.  The bus was running late, but then he finally saw the bus pull up to the bus stop.  He did not want to wait one more second so he talked to the bus driver and then took his seat on the bus.  He then took a good look out the window and watched as the bus began driving him to the first day of school he had been waiting for.  Finally, the bus came to a stop.  The children all ran off the bus towards the elementary school.  Joe did not see many other second grade students so he walked to the doors alone.

What did Kevin and Erin do in New York City FIRST?
There once was a girl named Erin who had a really close friend named Kevin.  They really liked being with each other, only it was difficult as Erin lived in England and Kevin lived in the United States.  Because they both liked traveling and Erin wanted to see Kevin, she planned a trip to see him in the United States one summer.  They had planned to travel around where Kevin lived and then go to see New York City at one point in order to see the sights and have a really nice steak dinner together.  Once Erin arrived and met Kevin at the airport, she ran up to him and jumped into his arms, giving him a great big hug.  They drove home where Kevin helped Erin organize her things before they changed and watched a movie together.  The next day, they went out to have breakfast at the diner.  They thought about getting eggs, French toast, or cereal... but couldn't make up their minds.  Finally, Kevin asked the worker to bring out pancakes for the two of them to share.  They had a really fun time together, visiting the beach, watching movies, and even visiting New York City like they had planned.  In the morning, they went to see the Empire State building.  In the afternoon, they saw the Statue of Liberty and Central Park.  At night, they went to have their dinner and went back to their hotel.  As Erin's trip was ending, Erin became really sad about leaving Kevin.  They talked and came up with a plan for the months ahead which made Erin feel a lot better.  Erin then went home and waited for Kyle to come to see her.

What was John shouting about that his mother heard.
One day when driving home John saw a group of bicycle racers riding down the road. When they stopped at a store he pulled over to talk to them. Their names were David, Mark, and Sam. When he asked them how they got into racing they each had a different story to tell. Sam started with his dad when he was much younger. Mark started when he met Sam, who was racing. David started when he saw a race on TV. John was very interested in learning to race bicycles like the three men he met. So he asked them where he could buy a bike like theirs, and how much would it cost. Sam said he would give him his old bike for free. Mark told him of a store nearby, and David told him of a store on the web. John said goodbye to the racers so that they could keep going on their ride. John then went home and left Sam a note so that he could pick up his old bike. He then went to his desk to look up some stuff on bike racing. He was so excited his mother heard him from the other room shouting about wheels. He looked into the safety parts of bike riding including the wrong time to ride and the stuff he would need like, a helmet and horn.

Where was William doing his homework?
William was sitting in his room working on his homework. It was something he did since he went to kindergarten. William could see outside from where he was sitting. He had a view of a beautiful sunset this time of year. It was late spring, and he sometimes found his mind wandering as he looked outside, and hated losing time like that. The sooner he finished his homework, the sooner he could go to his friend Jacob's house, where he was spending the night. William loved sleepovers with Jacob. They would do fun stuff like tell jokes, watch TV, play board games, and eat lots of junk food. Jacob also had a cool RC car that William liked to play with.

What time is it?
"How are you asleep? It's six in the morning!""Hello Dad," I said.  My dad thought waking me up early for father-son time was a treat.  I wished we could hang out at night instead. He sat in the chair at the foot of my bed with an enormously cheesy grin on his face, with a big shopping bag on his lap."What's in the bag, Dad?""I bought you some presents! You're a growing young man, and it is only right that you pick a sport." Dad dug through the bag, and pulled out a football and a baseball. "Any of these look good?""Dad, you know all I want in life is to join the circus! Why can't you let me be myself?"Dad leaned in closer to me, a serious look on his face. "Son, when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too. But when I got to high school, everybody made fun of me. They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day. They told me that nobody would marry me if I didn't give up my circus dreams.""Then how did you find Mom?""By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead!

What color is John's favorite shirt?
One Thursday morning, John's dad was making him breakfast. John came downstairs in his favorite blue shirt and fed his dog Bentley. After washing his hands, John sat down to a hot plate of pancakes, eggs, and bacon. John's baby sister Emily began to cry in her high chair. John gave Emily her pink pacifier to calm her down. After breakfast, John took Bentley out to the backyard to play fetch in the green grass. John only threw the ball a few times before it started to rain and they had to come back inside. Bentley shook himself to get the water off him and splashed John. John's dad asked John, "Do you want to play a game?" John said that he did and ran to get his favorite board game, Trouble. When they sat on the living room floor to play, Emily crawled over to sit in John's lap. Bentley lay next to John's dad with his head on his paws. John thought this rainy day was perfect.

A guy with brown hair was named Josh. His daughter was Maggie and her favorite activity was riding her yellow bike. Sometimes she would put a card in the spokes of the wheel. This made her bike sound much faster than it was going. Once when she was riding down a hill, she went too fast and hit a trashcan. Other than having a bad smell, she was ok but was afraid to tell her father what had happened. So she told a lie. When she looked her father in the eye, he saw that there was more to the story. When he found out Maggie was not being truthful, he had to give her a spanking. He told her that telling lies is wrong, but he loves her.

What did Frank, the knight, use as a weapon?
"Hey! That isn't fair! Knights can't fly! Only wizards like me can! And maybe also witches." Bobby yelled."Yes! They can, too!" Frank said, "They're the most powerful and you can't stop me from flying!""Well, if you fly, then I can fight with a sword, too. It's only fair," Bobby said back."No! They can't! They aren't even strong enough to pick up a sword. They can't even pick up a knife, they're so weak! I don't even know what you're talking about. You're crazy, aren't you?" Frank pointed his finger at Bobby and ran at him with the sword made out of cardboard.Bobby jumped out of the way as quickly as he could! Bobby then pointed a finger at Frank. "FREEZE!"Frank stopped in place. "Hey, you can't use the freeze spell. How can I fight you if I can't move? I'm going to tell mom.""I can use any spell I want! I can use Freeze, Trap, and Fly! I can do any of them!  I'm also telling mom that you think you can fly and you can't. You're a stupid knight with no brains. I have all the brains here." Bobby crossed his arms over his chest and stomped a foot on the ground."You take that back! I'm the smartest knight there is and I'll get you any day!" Suddenly, Frank pulled Bobby to the ground. "Take it back right now!""BOYS! What's all the noise?" Mom asked."Bobby called me stupid!" Frank yelled."Frank is trying to fly!" Bobby cried."Oh boy." Mom laughed.

Where was Jack when he saw the pond with ducks in it?
Once there was a dog named Noodle. Noodle had two brothers named Puff and Fluff, and a sister named Polly. Noodle's best friend was a boy named Jack. Jack went to school, but the dogs stayed home all day. Jack liked to feed Noodle chicken and beef. One day Jack went to the store and bought chicken for Noodle. Jack put too much chicken in Noodle's bowl. Noodle ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt. Poor Noodle! Jack was sad that he had made Noodle feel sick. Jack took Noodle, Puff, and Fluff to the park to run and play. Polly stayed home because she was sick. There were so many things to see at the park. Puff found a little red ladybug. Fluff found a big gray mouse. Noodle found a long brown stick. Jack found a deep pond with three ducks in it. Everyone had a great day at the park. Then the three dogs and Jack all went back home. When they got home, Polly was asleep on the bed. Polly said she was feeling better. Jack brought Polly some chicken noodle soup to eat. Noodle, Puff, and Fluff sat on the bed with Polly eating bones and drinking milk.

What has made the little boy sad
The day was dark and stormy; puddles could be seen all over the ground, making the yard look like a tiny pond.  Conner frowned as he let the curtain drop back down. There was no way that mommy was going to let him go out and play today. She would say that it was too muddy and he would get wet. Conner thought to himself, "But what if I don't ask her?"  Smiling, Conner pushed open the sliding door to the back yard.  Slipping on his rain boots, he rushed outside and began to run and jump from puddle to puddle, sending large showers of water up around him with every jump. After he had jumped in all of the puddles he looked back towards the house to find mommy standing in the doorway watching him with a smile on her face.

How did John feel about clapping?
Zebras cannot clap. However, one weekend a magic clown wiggled his nose and said a few magical words and a zebra could clap. This zebra lived in a zoo with many other zebras. This zebra's name was John, John the Zebra. John was so excited that he could clap. He tried to clap as much as he could. He had trouble understanding when and what to clap. He would clap at things that were sad and things that were happy. He clapped when he was excited and when he was scared. He even clapped that he could clap. After a couple of weeks, his friend Sam was getting annoyed with John. He said "John, I know you like clapping but I am beginning to be annoyed by your clapping." John said he was sorry, but that Sam did not understand how special it was to be the first Zebra that could clap. A few more weeks went by and the same Magical clown came by John's zoo.

Where does the elf hide?
The stinker was that no one let the elf in. He had waited at the door for four whole hours, but was afraid to knock in case the noise would wake the humans. This elf was the tooth fairy's helper, but one day hoped to work in the North Pole. That would never happen if he couldn't even help the tooth fairy with teeth on his first day working for her. It was almost morning now. Soon the children would wake up and run out the front door with their books for school. Inside, the tooth fairy would be wondering what was keeping him. "It's too dangerous to stay at this door," the elf thought, "The children might see me." Just then he heard the alarm clocks go off inside. He dove into a nearby bush and hid, hoping that his green uniform would help him match the color of the bush's leaves.

Why did Boots need a bath?
Janice spent the weekend at a family party in Moore, Georgia. While she was there, she played with her cousin Justine. The two of them rode tricycles, shared presents, and bought their favorite gum together. Janice's favorite part of the weekend was swimming in the lake with Justine and her dog, Boots. Boots did not like the water at first, but soon was splashing around with them. His favorite thing to do was fetch sticks from the water. They also went on a fast boat around the lake. Justine's favorite thing to do was ride in a tube behind the boat. When they got out, they were soaking wet. They dried off with towels before going to Greg's Country Store for some lemon ice box cake. Boots got so muddy at the lake! When they got back to the cabin, they had to give him a bath. Because they were so active during the day, they fell asleep quickly and slept until the morning.

What did Jess trade for the bowl?
There was once a leprechaun named Tony who spent his days at the end of a rainbow guarding his golden bowl of cereal. Tony was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl. That is, until an angel named Jess fell from Heaven. Jess had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on Earth, and could not return to the sky. So she chose to make the best of it and went to see all of the beautiful and interesting things on Earth. One day, she came across Tony's rainbow, and was amazed by it. She followed the rainbow to the end, wondering what could be there. Then she saw it: Tony's golden bowl. From the time she saw the bowl, she knew she wanted it.  She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in Heaven, but she never tried it for herself. When she went to have some of the cereal, Tony the Leprechaun popped out from behind the rainbow and laughed at her. "Don't you know," he said, "that I'm the toughest leprechaun in all the land? What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?" The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him. So she left to find something to trade. She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting. She thought that Tony might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, "I've come bearing a seesaw." When Tony saw the seesaw, he loved it. He didn't argue or laugh at Jess, and traded for his bowl right there. Jess ate from it, and it was delicious.

What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?" The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him. So she left to find something to trade. She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting. She thought that Tony might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, "I've come bearing a seesaw." When Tony saw the seesaw, he loved it. He didn't argue or laugh at Jess, and traded for his bowl right there. Jess ate from it, and it was delicious.

Who was Tony?
There was once a leprechaun named Tony who spent his days at the end of a rainbow guarding his golden bowl of cereal. Tony was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl. That is, until an angel named Jess fell from Heaven. Jess had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on Earth, and could not return to the sky. So she chose to make the best of it and went to see all of the beautiful and interesting things on Earth. One day, she came across Tony's rainbow, and was amazed by it. She followed the rainbow to the end, wondering what could be there. Then she saw it: Tony's golden bowl. From the time she saw the bowl, she knew she wanted it.  She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in Heaven, but she never tried it for herself. When she went to have some of the cereal, Tony the Leprechaun popped out from behind the rainbow and laughed at her. "Don't you know," he said, "that I'm the toughest leprechaun in all the land? What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?" The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him. So she left to find something to trade.

What is the name of the cat?
Once upon a time there was a cat named Pizza.  Pizza was black with four white feet and a brown tail.  Pizza had three friends.  They were Dig the dog, Mittens the rooster, and Bub the duck.  When they were in school one day, their teacher told them the story of the super scary sock monster.  She warned them to stay as far away from the sock monster as they could.  Wanting to show how brave they were, Pizza, Dig, Mittens, and Bub went off to take a picture of the sock monster.  Before they left, they each packed one type of fruit.  Pizza packed an apple.  Dig packed a pear.  Mittens packed a banana.  Bub packed a grape.It took a long time but they finally found the sock monster.  He lived in a cave.  The cave was under the school.  The sock monster was not looking in their direction when they found him.  As quiet as they could, they walked up to him.  Pizza got the camera ready.  Just as Pizza was about to take the picture, Bub tripped over a stick.  The noise caused the sock monster to look at the brave friends.  The sock monster was angry!  "He looks mad!  What can we do?" wondered Mittens?  "Maybe he likes fruit." said Pizza, "Let's throw him the fruit we packed."Pizza gave the sock monster his apple.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Bub gave the sock monster his grape.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Mittens gave the sock monster her banana.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Dig gave the sock monster her pear.  The sock monster ate it!  "Thanks!" said the sock monster.  "I was really hungry.  Pears are my favorite."No longer hungry, the sock monster let Pizza take a picture.  The brave friends returned to their teacher and showed her the picture.  "You are all very brave," said the teacher.  "But you didn't listen to me.  I am keeping the picture.  It is your punishment."The brave friends were very sorry.

What was the secret Jack knew about?
So, there was this kid named Jack that came up to my beanstalk one day. I couldn't believe my eyes, so I put down my ham sandwich I was eating and looked at him. I'm not sure what he thought he was doing there, but he sure did talk a lot. He kept asking me questions about this and then he asked me some questions about that and I was getting a little bit tired of all of the questions.When I thought I wouldn't hear the end of everything, this Jack kid asked me about the one and only secret that I've always kept to myself. That no one even knew about! No, it wasn't about my golden guitar or even my goose that laid eggs filled with coins. No, he was asking me about my beans and their roots. You see, I'm a giant and my job is to make sure the bean roots that we use to get down to earth are well protected and guarded. They're what helps us get down to the little person world when we need to. I became a little bit worried as the little kid asked more and more questions about my roots. I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library!I walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots, well, he got me with his little knife and I dropped him! Thankfully, he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad! He ran down the beanstalk when I chased after him. I guess he wanted to get back to his little people. I didn't follow him, but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff.

What food was Grandma holding when she was standing at the door?
On Tuesday, Timmy went to go visit his grandma for the day. She lived in a town close to where Timmy lived, so Timmy got in the car and his mom drove him to his grandma's house. Timmy wanted to bring his big white dog with him, but his mom said no because his grandma doesn't like dogs. Instead, Timmy brought his favorite toys: a blue car, a puzzle with a picture of green trees on it, and a few fun board games in brown boxes. When Timmy got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him. She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him. "Hi, Timmy!" She said. "Hi, Grandma!" Timmy said. "I'm so happy to see you!"Grandma smiled. "We're going to have so much fun today, Timmy. I have ham sandwiches, chips, and fresh lemonade for lunch, and I also have a whole plate of warm cookies all for you.""Wow, Grandma, that sounds great! I brought some games for us to play. This is going to be a great day!" Grandma and Timmy went inside Grandma's house and Timmy opened his bag of toys to show Grandma. She looked at the car, the puzzle, and the games, and then looked at Timmy. "Well, Timmy, what do you want to do first?" She asked. Timmy chose the puzzle, and they spent a few hours putting it together. Then, they ate lunch. The sandwiches, chips, lemonade and cookies are all delicious. Timmy ate three whole cookies by himself. After lunch, they played outside with the car, and then when they got tired, they sat on the porch and rested. It was starting to get dark out. "I had a great day, Timmy," Grandma said. Timmy smiled. "Me too, Grandma. I love spending time with you!" Timmy thought it had been a perfect day, even if he couldn't bring his dog.

On Tuesday, Timmy went to go visit his grandma for the day. She lived in a town close to where Timmy lived, so Timmy got in the car and his mom drove him to his grandma's house. Timmy wanted to bring his big white dog with him, but his mom said no because his grandma doesn't like dogs. Instead, Timmy brought his favorite toys: a blue car, a puzzle with a picture of green trees on it, and a few fun board games in brown boxes. When Timmy got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him. She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him. "Hi, Timmy!" She said. "Hi, Grandma!" Timmy said. "I'm so happy to see you!"Grandma smiled. "We're going to have so much fun today, Timmy. I have ham sandwiches, chips, and fresh lemonade for lunch, and I also have a whole plate of warm cookies all for you.""Wow, Grandma, that sounds great! I brought some games for us to play. This is going to be a great day!" Grandma and Timmy went inside Grandma's house and Timmy opened his bag of toys to show Grandma. She looked at the car, the puzzle, and the games, and then looked at Timmy. "Well, Timmy, what do you want to do first?" She asked. Timmy chose the puzzle, and they spent a few hours putting it together. Then, they ate lunch. The sandwiches, chips, lemonade and cookies are all delicious. Timmy ate three whole cookies by himself. After lunch, they played outside with the car, and then when they got tired, they sat on the porch and rested. It was starting to get dark out. "I had a great day, Timmy," Grandma said. Timmy smiled. "Me too, Grandma. I love spending time with you!" Timmy thought it had been a perfect day, even if he couldn't bring his dog.

What is the name of the mom in the story?
One Saturday afternoon about the second week of May, Maggie and her mom Jan went to the dentist. Maggie was seven years old and she was scared of the dentist, but her mom promised to fix her favorite chicken dish for dinner if Maggie was a good girl. "At least it's not the doctor's!" she said. They got to the dentist office and Jan told the woman, named Tiffany, at the front desk that they were there. There were lots of toys in the waiting room but Maggie was too nervous to enjoy them like the other kids. Finally, a woman came and told Maggie and Jan that it was Maggie's turn. They made a right turn and went to the third room on the left. Maggie sat down in the dentist's chair. A woman, Mary, came in and cleaned her teeth and told Maggie and Jan that Maggie had done well with her brushing. Then the dentist, Taylor, came in and did a checkup. He saw that everything was good and that Maggie had no problems with her teeth. He gave Maggie a bag with a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a sugar free candy. There was also a smiley face sticker in the bag. Jan was proud of her daughter and stopped at the grocery store to get ingredients for the chicken dish for dinner as promised.

What is the main watermelon's name?
Seedy the watermelon was a very special type of watermelon. He didn't have any seeds. He was green and he had stripes. All of his cousins had seeds, but he didn't have any. He felt very left out. He couldn't thing of why he was different. His mom told him it was because he was a very special watermelon. She also tells him she loves him the way he is. But Seedy didn't think it was a good thing. He wished he could be like everyone else and have seeds. One day, he rolled out to the lawn and looked at all of his new cousins growing in the garden. He rolled around until he found a little baby watermelon that didn't have any seeds either. He sat next to him and talked to him. He told him that he was very special, and was excited for him to be picked off the vine and be his special best friend. He would name him Seedy, Jr.

what did he get the seeds for?
I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up, digging, throwing, building, smashing, everything, so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables. It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds! The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden. We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them. Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes. Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten. Every day they would get even bigger. That was the most exciting part! Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes. And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red. This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner.

What were the best days for the wolf?
There once was a wolf that liked to scare the other forest animals. By daylight he pretended to be a kind, nice wolf. By night, he would circle the forest and hunt down his food. When he was very hungry, he would find humans and woof like a dog in hopes that someone would feed him. The wolf's favorite food was meat seasoned with lemon. The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it. Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach. On other days, he goes home hungry. Sometimes there would be a knock on his door, and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day. Those days were the best for the wolf, by far.

When he was very hungry, he would find humans and woof like a dog in hopes that someone would feed him. The wolf's favorite food was meat seasoned with lemon. The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it. Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach. On other days, he goes home hungry. Sometimes there would be a knock on his door, and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day. Those days were the best for the wolf, by far.

where did his father have to be?
My mother and I were in the kitchen fixing dinner. I was setting the table as she was cooking when we heard my father. We went into the living room to see what he needed. He could not find the keys to his truck. We all started looking all over the place and could not seem to find them. My father needed to go to work so he took the keys for my mom's van and left for work. We kept looking for them and when we were about to give up my little brother came walking out of the garage with them in his hands. He was in the garage playing with his bike. My mother called my father at work to tell him the great news. He was happy and we then ate our dinner.

What has Lilly always wanted to do?
I couldn't believe today had come! It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store. First off, let me say that my name is Lilly, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday! Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!\tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day. It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow!

How many bears were there?
I once was walking in the woods with my friends. The day was very nice, there were a lot of trees. The walk was part of a week long trip I took with Boy Scouts. This day was day number three of our trip. There was four of us walking. We were walking down a path when all of the sudden we came across a bear. This scared us. Bears can be dangerous. A few seconds later we saw another bear, there was not only one. This bear was a baby bear. A leader told us that a bear with a baby can be much more dangerous. We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear. The leader told us not to walk towards the bear. You also can not make any quick motions. The leader said we needed to start talking to make noise and to start to walk away from the bears. After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe.

Why did he want to look at ladders in town?
At the farm, the farmer found that he needed to go to the town to get some tools.  He needed to pick up five things at the store.  The farmer needed to get a shovel, some hay, extra string, feed for the horses and a tire for his truck.  He also found that one of the steps on his ladder was broken and needed to be fixed.  He would have to get some wood to fix the ladder.  He thought he might like to look at new ladders and see if it was time to get a new one.  He went into the house and found his keys.  He started driving down the road when he found that he forgot his wallet and needed to go back to the house.  He turned the truck around and went back to the house.

The truck also had a ladder that was three feet long.  Andrew had asked for it for his birthday but didn't get it.  He did get a camera from his uncle and a puzzle from his friend.  In order to make the money his mom told him that he needed to do chores around the house.  His mom told him that he could make five dollars by mowing the lawn.  He chose to do this chore and it took him three hours.  She then gave him the money.  He also chose to walk the dog every day for a week which made him one dollar a day.  His grandpa gave him a late birthday present for his birthday.  His grandpa's gift was twelve dollars.  He spent the afternoon counting his money and found that he was still short of his goal.

The truck also had a ladder that was three feet long.  Andrew had asked for it for his birthday but didn't get it.  He did get a camera from his uncle and a puzzle from his friend.  In order to make the money his mom told him that he needed to do chores around the house.  His mom told him that he could make five dollars by mowing the lawn.  He chose to do this chore and it took him three hours.  She then gave him the money.  He also chose to walk the dog every day for a week which made him one dollar a day.  His grandpa gave him a late birthday present for his birthday.  His grandpa's gift was twelve dollars.  He spent the afternoon counting his money and found that he was still short of his goal.

Bobo barked. \tabCharlie looked at Bobo and smiled, and then grabbed his brown hat from the table. Next to his hat there was a picture of a rainbow that Samantha had drawn for Charlie.

Charlie, seeing the two looking at each other, made the choice that enough was enough and opened the door to walk outside. Samantha was standing outside the house on the lawn, and with a yell, she surprised Charlie! With a wave of her hand, she showed him the duck that she was watching.

Who did I give the zucchini to?
One summer when I was sixteen, I planted a vegetable garden. I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants. My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week. I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor. I gave some to my parents to take to their friends. Then I went door to door and gave zucchini to everyone in the neighborhood.

What did the other alligators do when they first saw the sweater before the cold night?
There was once an alligator who liked to wear orange sweaters. He liked that is was orange instead of a boring color like white or black. All of the other alligators would laugh and point at him and say mean things about him. They would say it was silly for an alligator to wear a sweater. One night it got very cold and the ground was very hard. The alligator rested well with his sweater to keep his tummy warm and protected from the cold ground. After that night all of the alligators wore different colored sweaters (red, blue, green, and yellow) and were safe and warm from the cold weather. They thanked him and apologized for laughing before. The point of this story is that sometimes silly ideas turn out to be the best ideas and we shouldn't make fun of others.

What did Randy find in the spaghetti the second time?
Randy was a boy who loved to eat spaghetti. One day he met a girl named Hilda. People said that Hilda made the best spaghetti in the world. So Randy wanted to try some of Hilda's spaghetti. He asked Hilda, "Hilda, would you make me some spaghetti please?" Hilda said, "Sure! Just come to my house tomorrow!" So the next day Randy went to Hilda's house, sat down in the dining room, and waited.Then Hilda came out with a big plate of spaghetti with spinach soup. The only problem was that the spaghetti was bright blue. Randy said, "This spaghetti is blue! The soup is blue also! I hate the color blue and I won't eat any blue food!" This made Hilda sad, and she started to cry. This made Randy feel bad so he said, "It's okay, Hilda. Don't cry. I'll let you try again."So Hilda made a new plate of spaghetti for Randy. This time it wasn't blue and came with a salad with cheese. Randy said, "That's much better!" Then he started to eat. Suddenly Randy spit out all the spaghetti because there was a big nasty bug in it. This made Randy very angry and he threw all the spaghetti on the floor. Hilda said, "I'm so sorry, I don't know how that got there!" Randy calmed down and said, "I'm sorry too. Let's forget the spaghetti. I can eat the salad instead." When Randy finished the salad, Hilda asked if Randy wanted dessert. Randy said "no" because he was too full.

So they woke up their father and went downstairs for breakfast. It was so early in the morning the sun was not even out yet. But their dad knew once the kids were up, there was no going back to sleep, so he got started.He gave them each a banana to start. He let them pick either a biscuit or toast. They chose toast. So he made wheat bread toast and put grape jelly on it. The quickly ate it and the orange juice they were given. They then each had a bowl of Rice Krispies before getting showered and dressed. They kissed their mom as she went to work and began enjoying the day off from school by playing in their rooms.Dad thought he'd done a good job feeding the kids. But in two hours, they both were asking for turkey sandwiches for lunch. With Tim and Janey so hungry so soon, their dad knew he was in for a long day.And a busy one in the kitchen.

What did Davy do to tease Kelsey?
Kelsey's uncle Jack gave him and his brother, Davy, some chalk to play with. Kelsey was a pretty good artist. His family said that all of his drawings looked real. His brother was sad that he was not as good at art and drawing as Kelsey. Davy teased Kelsey to take his mind off the fact that he was not as good at art. He called Kelsey names and pretended to be a monster to scare Kelsey when he wasn't paying attention. When their mother gave them some chocolate as a treat, Davy took all of it and wouldn't let Kelsey have any. Uncle Jack finally saw that Davy was hurting his brother, so he sat down to talk to him. After lots of questioning, Davy told his uncle the truth. "Instead of teasing your brother," Uncle Jack said, "why don't you ask him to teach you how to draw some things? He's used to his big brother knowing everything. I think he would like to teach you some things." Davy looked at the ground and finally said, "Okay."

What did Lionel do for King?
There was once a lion that lived in a circus. This lion, King, was the biggest lion in the zoo, and he was often mean to the other lions in the circus. He was giant, and because of this, he scared the other lions, including the smallest one, Lionel. Lionel was often bullied by King, and the other lions, like Mack and Oscar, who copied him. Lionel was hiding one day from King, when the man who owned the circus took King out for training. King had to perform very difficult jobs for the circus, and when he did not get them right away, the circus man was very mean to King. King came back to the lion pen and was very scared and hurt. All of the other lions, even Mack and Oscar, ignored King, except for Lionel. Lionel sat down next to King and scared away the lion cubs who might have bothered King. King was very glad for what Lionel did. When King kept learning the new stuff for the circus man, Lionel kept him company when he got back. Soon, they grew to be good friends, and King found himself very sorry for all of the mean things he did to Lionel.

Who got off the bus before Dan?
Dan and his class were going to the ocean. Along with his class there were three adults going to make sure no one was left at the beach. Dan had three friends who were going too. His friends who were going were Tom, Steve and Jeff. Tom was the first one on the bus. Dan was the second one on the bus. Steve got on next and then Jeff got on last. If the sun was shining and there was not a storm, Dan was going to get to go on a boat to look for fish.

Who was lost in the woods?
Many, many years back, in a place full of magic, there lived a man and a woman who were married. The man and woman did not love one another or anything else. The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood. One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost. After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, "I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world."Since there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise. In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter. Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him. And every time the girl said no, the wizard would find a new way to make her sad. But the girl had found a secret flower that was very beautiful."If you marry me I can let you out.""There is a lovely bit of sunlight that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his eyesHe blocked out the sun so the girl lived only in darkness. Still the girl said no. The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out." The wizard became angry and steam poured from his mouth"There is a lovely stream of water that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his earsHe blocked out the water so the girl lived only in dry sand. Still the girl said no. The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out."Again, the girl only said "There is a soft wind that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears and fire came out of his eyesSo the Wizard blocked out the wind and left the girl in a hot cave with no air. But the girl would still not marry him. The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up. The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone. Instead she found a handsome prince. "I thank you my lady," he said, "for saving me from the evil wizard. In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy."The girl said yes. In time they came to love one another and got married and lived happy together.

What dish was Janet's father making for breakfast?
Janet walked past the barn, the big tree, and through the back yard to reach the chicken pen. Janet gathered the eggs from the chicken pen, so that her father could make scrambled eggs for breakfast. He would need at least 5 eggs for the meal, two for Janet and three for himself. Janet could only find four eggs in the chicken pen. She looked under every chicken, and in every nest, but could not find another egg. She placed the four eggs in her basket, and began to walk toward the house, when she heard a quacking sound. She went toward the sound and found a nest near the pond, with large brown eggs inside. "Quack" said a nearby duck, as Janet took an egg from the nest. Now she had enough for breakfast.

Why did the dog almost get yelled at?
One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it. We piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip. When we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water. It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.When I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.When we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember.

What happened when Juan and Amy went to get the yogurt?
Juan and Amy were happy because they were going to help their mom make a cake. They were making the cake for their dad who was returning from a long trip. Amy thought about all the things she wanted to do with her dad when he got back. They would go to the park and he could push her on the swing then they could take their dog for a walk and have a long talk like they used to do. Juan was also thinking about all the things he and his dad could do when he got back. Maybe they could all go to the river like last year and his dad could teach him how to skip stones across the river. They could share hotdogs like last year too. "What are you two doing in here?" Their mom asked. "We are waiting to help you with Dad's cake." Juan said. "Okay, you two get out the yogurt for the frosting and I am going to start the oven to get it warmer." "Oh no! I spilled the punch when Juan was closing the door." Amy cried. "It is okay we can clean that up in no time." Juan said and grabbed the paper towels. Just as their mom was mixing the cake ingredients Juan and Amy heard their dog bark. "Mom! The dog is barking someone is here." Juan said. "Well your dad is not going to be here until this afternoon.

What is the young girl's name?
Once there was a young girl named Angel.  Angel was very nervous because she was about to give a speech for school.  The student that gave the best speech would win free tickets to see the fireworks.  Angel had spent a lot of time practicing her speech because she really wanted to win.  She practiced in front of her cousin, Noah.  She practiced in front of her stuffed tiger, Kitten.  She practiced saying her speech as she stood on one leg and looked at the ceiling.  She even practiced burping her speech!Despite all that practice, Angel was still very nervous.  So many other kids were giving speeches that day and they all were going to try their best!  As Angel was walking in to the school she saw a penny on the ground.  Her mother had always told her that pennies were lucky so she picked it up.  With the penny in her hand she felt less nervous.  It was her new lucky coin.When Angel's turn came she gave her speech.  She remembered all of the words to her speech and she remembered to smile at the right times.  Her hard work and her lucky coin worked.  She won the free fireworks tickets!  Angel's teacher, Mr. Coffee, was so proud of her that he turned her lucky coin into a necklace.  Angel wore it everywhere she went from then on.  The fireworks were pretty cool too.

Who did not help build the boat?
Josh was going on an adventure.  He was going to float down the river with his friends, Dennis and Connor.  They had been building a boat out of wood Connor's father had given them for the last week.  The boys wanted to paint the boat because the brown wood did not look very good.  Josh wanted green, Dennis liked purple and Connor said it would look good if it was red.  They had to call their friend, Tonya, to help choose.  Tonya thought the same as Josh on the color so that is what they painted the boat.  To thank Tonya for helping them choose the color, the boys invited her to come with them.  All four of them carried the boat through the vegetable garden in the back yard.  They were very careful not to step on any of the carrots, potatoes or green beans.  Josh's mother had packed some food for them to eat as they floated down the river.  Everything was in a big basket.  There were peanut butter sandwiches, potato chips and cupcakes with strawberry frosting.  Each person had a job on the boat.  Josh was the captain.  Dennis made sure the snacks did not get wet.  Tonya watched for rocks ahead.  Connor had to steer the boat.

Tonya thought the same as Josh on the color so that is what they painted the boat.  To thank Tonya for helping them choose the color, the boys invited her to come with them.  All four of them carried the boat through the vegetable garden in the back yard.  They were very careful not to step on any of the carrots, potatoes or green beans.  Josh's mother had packed some food for them to eat as they floated down the river.  Everything was in a big basket.  There were peanut butter sandwiches, potato chips and cupcakes with strawberry frosting.  Each person had a job on the boat.  Josh was the captain.  Dennis made sure the snacks did not get wet.  Tonya watched for rocks ahead.  Connor had to steer the boat.

What did the house come with?
Maria was a teacher at a small school in Arizona. Maria had worked in the past at schools in California, Texas, and Vermont, but had to leave these schools because the school in Arizona was perfect for her dream job. When she moved to Arizona she found a small little one bedroom house that fit her perfectly. The house was on the top floor of another building, owned by another teacher. In her house was a bed, dresser, table and telephone. Nothing else came with the house. So Maria wanted to go shopping with her new teacher friend. So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house. First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table. Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom. Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room. When she got to the couch store she had a few different choices. She could buy the biggest couch they had but would go over her limit, it was black. She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown. Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red. Maria went with the middle couch knowing she would not like the color of the smaller one even if it was least expensive. Maria then had to choose if she wanted them to deliver her couch or if she would pick it up. Knowing she had only a small car she went with the deliver choice. She also had to choose if she wanted them to set up the couch for her or for her to set it up herself. She went with them setting it up since they would be there to deliver it anyway. Maria loved her new house and job.

What did Bill think had happened to his room after the door slammed shut?
Once there was a boy named Bill who liked to play at being a cowboy. One day he was playing at chasing Indians in his room when he heard a loud crack of thunder. He got really scared. Bill's parents, Ned and Susan, came into his room. They told him not to be scared. They said they were going to make sure the car windows were shut and they would be back soon. Bill said okay. He climbed under his bed and listened to the wind outside. He had his favorite toy gun to keep him safe, but he was still scared because his parents weren't back yet. His brother Zack had given him the gun. Bill started to think he could hear voices in the wind. It sounded like a strange kind of chanting. He started to shake and hug his toy gun. He said, "I'm not afraid of you. If you try to hurt me I'll shoot you." After that he felt a little better. But then he jumped as his bedroom door slammed shut. He hit his head on the bottom of his bed and it hurt. He looked out from under his blanket and saw a strange orange light in his room. He was worried that it was on fire, but he couldn't smell any smoke.

His brother Zack had given him the gun. Bill started to think he could hear voices in the wind. It sounded like a strange kind of chanting. He started to shake and hug his toy gun. He said, "I'm not afraid of you. If you try to hurt me I'll shoot you." After that he felt a little better. But then he jumped as his bedroom door slammed shut. He hit his head on the bottom of his bed and it hurt. He looked out from under his blanket and saw a strange orange light in his room. He was worried that it was on fire, but he couldn't smell any smoke.

Which of the following was a camp activity.
This summer Frank and his friends went to Boy Scout camp for two weeks. At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.At first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks. But Frank's scout masters explained to Frank's mom that the camp leaders were very serious about taking care of the campers and that everything would be perfectly safe for Frank. Frank promised to call home at least every two days. So in the end Frank's mom let Frank go to camp.
