       "   'p': \"`` The Octopus , '' a masked crime lord , is bent on crippling the nation with a wave of terror .  He starts with the transportation system and then moves onto industry .  He demands tribute from railroad magnates and other captains of industry .  Richard Wentworth , an amateur criminologist who is friendly with the police , is secretly `` The Spider , '' a masked vigilante equally determined to wipe the Octopus and his gang off the face of the earth .  Pleasant and smiling in civilian life , Wentworth is often ruthless as the Spider , slinging two guns against the public enemies who attack him .  Wentworth also masquerades as affable underworld lowlife Blinky McQuade .  Disguised as McQuade , Wentworth can infiltrate gangland at the hired-gun level and keep current on the gang's plans .  The only people who know Wentworth's other identities are his assistants Jackson and Ram Singh , his butler Jenkins , and his fianc e Nita .  The Octopus was a villain in a single issue pulp believed to have been written by Norvell Page who wrote most of The Spider pulp stories .  He is garbed completely in white and is only ever seen sitting in a chair .  Unlike the pulps , The Spider is garbed in a lightweight full length costume with web-like markings on it Which resemble Spiderman's costume .  The serial follows the standard formula of fights , shoot-outs , Wentworth's friends being kidnapped at various times and having to be rescued .  Each chapter ends with The Spider or his friends in deep trouble , often about to be killed , but the effect is spoiled by a trailer for the next episode Which shows them in full health and fighting the villains .\",\n",

During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \"Mayday\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit.  The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing.  The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\"  On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers.  This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001.  But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation.  The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams.  They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff.  On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers.  The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida\\'s Orlando International Airport in August.  Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight.  FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel.  We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight.  All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them.  We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.',\n",

       "  {'q': 'Bin Laden delivered diatribes in what two locations?',\n",
       "   'p': 'Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia.  He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan.  In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands.  Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in Bin Laden\\'s public fatwa in August 1996.  In ensuing weeks, Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\"  By this time, Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.  Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons.  Some of Bin Laden\\'s close comrades were more peers than subordinates.  For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan.  The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Laden admired, was also in the network.  Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.  There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else\\'s organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.  In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.  Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections.  And in this network, Bin Laden\\'s agenda stood out.

       "   'p': 'Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes.  The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service.  The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas.  \"We feel much better about this fire today,\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service.  He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds.  The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday.  Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters.  Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer.  Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said.  On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported.  The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire.  \"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire.  Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire.  \"I\\'m just moving them from pasture to pasture,\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock.  \"As one pasture burns, I\\'m moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\"',\n",
