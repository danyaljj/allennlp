While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet.  Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft.  During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \"Mayday\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit.  The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing.  The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\"  On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers.  This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001.  But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation.  The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams.  They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff.  On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers.  The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August.  Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight.  FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel.  We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight.  All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them.  We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The"}], "question": "How much time passed between the 1st radio mayday transmission and the second?", "id": "26"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The"}], "question": "What was below average for this particular day?", "id": "27"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The"}], "question": "Which two factors were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93?", "id": "28"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The"}], "question": "Jarrah remained seated where during the takeover?", "id": "29"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The"}], "question": "When did the captain (or first officer) demand that the attacker \"get out of here!\"?", "id": "30"}]}, {"context": "Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia.  He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan.  In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands.  Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996.  In ensuing weeks, Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\"  By this time, Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.  Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons.  Some of Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates.  For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan.  The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Laden admired, was also in the network.  Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.  There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.  In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.  Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections.  And in this network, Bin Laden's agenda stood out.  While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya, Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States.

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei.  Sarawak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban\u00e2\u20ac\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u201aSea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers.  (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities.  ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony.  Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore.  In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei.  He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit.  In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier).  He tried to halt the Dayaks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morally acceptable\u00e2\u20ac\u009d customs.  His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted.  His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border.  Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula.  In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles.  More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life.  He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace.

The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving.  To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution.  Article 9 renounced Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-defense\u00e2\u20ac\u009d force.  The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again.  The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier.  The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future stunning economic success.  Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry back on its feet.  Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on.

It was Japan that produced the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first transistor radio.  The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary.  Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times.
