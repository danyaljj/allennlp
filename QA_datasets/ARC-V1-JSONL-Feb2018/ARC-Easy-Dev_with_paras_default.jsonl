The reason why the ball did not go straight upward when being kick but come down to earth is because the ball is being pulled down by gravity. The force of gravity constantly pulls down on the ball. As the temperature goes up, the electrical resistance comes down and that is converted to a temperature reading on the display. Topspin helps a bounce pass travel farther, horizontally, while backspin makes the ball easier to catch because the friction of the ball hitting the floor slows the ball down. Friction is the reason why the soccer ball always slows down. But, in real life the friction force varies along the surface as the ball rolls and this causes the ball to slow down (if it increases) and hence eventually stop.
