Phenotypic plasticity allows populations and species to accommodate environmental variation; greater plasticity will allow population survival in the short term without necessitating selection for genetic change. This genetic diversity is what, along with environmental factors, allows a species to change with time, where strong genes survive and weak ones perish.

Tropical storms form over warm ocean waters, which supply the energy for hurricanes and typhoons to grow and move, often over land. When hurricanes move over land, they usually start to weaken quickly because they no longer have their source of fuel: warm moist air above the sea. warm moist air is forced to move over a mountain range.

Conduction is when heat flows through a heated solid through a heat current moving through the material. When the molecules collide, they transfer energy to each other in varying degrees, based on how they collide. Energy is transferred when one molecule collides with another. Molecules transfer their kinetic energy to other molecules through conduction. If two molecules collide, an energy transfer from the molecule with greater kinetic energy to the molecule with less kinetic energy occurs. Conduction happens when energetic molecules (the hot coals) that are vibrating collide with more sedate molecules (the soles of the feet) and transfer their energy to them.

Some of the whitest sand in the world, along Florida 's Emerald Coast , comes from the erosion of quartz in the Appalachian Mountains. The valley is drained by the Missouri and Mississippi River systems, which have carried sediment from both the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains and sorted and deposited these sediments (Dix, 1964). The collisions of the continents produced the Appalachian mountain belt of eastern North America and the Hercynian Mountains in the United Kingdom. The Appalachian Mountain Range is an ancient example of this collision type and is also marked on the map.

Taking growth hormone can impact how the body responds to insulin , which controls blood glucose levels. In response to high glucose levels, mitochondria help trigger the release of insulin , which stimulates cells to take up glucose from the blood. After a meal, blood glucose levels rise, prompting the release of insulin, which causes cells to take up glucose, and liver and skeletal muscle cells to form the carbohydrate glycogen .

Properties of materials such as electrical conduction and heat capacity are investigated by solid state physics. For example, after measuring physical properties, students might investigate the relationship between the density of certain liquids and their boiling points. Melting and Freezing allows students to investigate what happens to the amount of different substances as they change from a solid to a liquid or a liquid to a solid. Melting and Boiling Points Physical Properties and Changes 1 This is a physical change , and the melting point is a physical property .

A spiral galaxy consists of a flattened disk , with stars forming a (usually two-armed) spiral structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge . It may refer to material surrounding a newly-formed star; material accreting onto a black hole or neutron star ; or the large region of a spiral galaxy containing the spiral arms.

Heat is transferred as energy in all of these cases, radiating in temperature-responsive waves. Heat energy is often transferred by infrared electromagnetic radiation. The third way to transfer heat, in addition to convection and conduction, is by radiation, in which energy is transferred in the form of electromagnetic waves.

As the numbers of the predator species increase, the prey population begins to decline. If the number of blue wildebeest killed by humans increases as human populations increase, the species could face a permanent decline (10) . Identify contributing factors that are causing this trend in declining numbers of native species. Increases in the overwintering population may be due to an increase in the number of bird feeders, while the total population may be declining.

The formation of a solid ( ice ) from liquid ( water ) represents a decrease in entropy . However, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In open systems, entropy can decrease in local regions (e.g., the ice tray), but an increase in order in the open system is always paid for by a decrease in order (decrease in entropy) somewhere else (e.g., the outside room). In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. If we unplug a refrigerator, heat will flow to the interior from the surroundings; the entropy increase inside the refrigerator will be greater than the entropy decrease in the surroundings, and the net entropy change is positive. For example, you can pump heat out of a refrigerator (to make ice cubes), but the heat is placed in the house and the entropy of the house increases, even though the local entropy of the ice cube tray decreases.", "id": "Mercury_7142748", "answerKey": "B"}

Milligrams measure an object's mass, while milliliters measure the volume of liquids. Likewise, liquid capacity is typically measured using liter units such as milliliter. The volume measurement unit cc (cubic centimeter) is usually replaced by the liquid volume measure unit ml (milliliter). A cubic centimeter can be used as a measurement for the volume of anything, not just liquids.", "id": "MEAP_2004_8_48", "answerKey": "C"}

The law of conservation of energy states that when one form of energy is converted to another, no energy is destroyed in the process.

Mechanical weathering is a type of weathering in which rocks and minerals break down into smaller pieces. Weathering is the process of breaking down rocks and minerals into smaller pieces by water, wind, and ice. Mechanical weathering breaks rocks into smaller and smaller pieces but without otherwise altering the minerals. Specific classes of mineral break apart in characteristic ways, and the size of the pieces into which the original weathered rock is broken has a great deal to do with the character of the soil that it forms. Mechanical weathering is accomplished by physical forces that break rock into smaller and smaller pieces without changing the rock's mineral composition.", "id": "Mercury_SC_408243", "answerKey": "D"}

The skeleton of a bird is adapted for flight because many bones are hollow, making the bird lightweight. Most birds have hollow bones so they weigh less and make flight possible.
