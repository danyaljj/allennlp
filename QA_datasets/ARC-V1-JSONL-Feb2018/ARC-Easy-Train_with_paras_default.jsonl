Insulin is released after eating protein and especially after eating carbohydrates, which increase glucose levels in the blood. Eating a lot of carbohydrates results in rapid rise in blood glucose level which triggers the body to release more insulin. The pancreas squirts insulin into the bloodstream when glucose levels rise as a result of eating carbohydrates . This process, called ketosis , begins when insulin levels are low; in normal humans, insulin is lowest when blood glucose levels are low (mostly before eating). When the concentration of blood glucose raises such in after eating, beta cells secret insulin into the blood.

Earth's water cycle involves the following main physical processes: Evaporation Is the transfer of water from bodies of surface water into the atmosphere. In the water cycle liquid water evaporates from earth's surface and forms water vapor, a gas, in the atmosphere. The water cycle, or hydrologic cycle, is a continuous process by which water is purified by evaporation and transported from the earth's surface (including the oceans) to the atmosphere and back to the land and oceans. The evaporation of surface water is a key part of the water cycle that allows the continuous movement of water between the Earth and the Earth's atmosphere. The combined processes by which water is transferred from the earth surface to the atmosphere; evaporation of liquid or solid water plus transpiration from plants.

This leaf-nosed bat uses sound waves and echoes--a technique called echolocation--to capture prey, such as crickets. Individual bats emit sonar calls in the dark, using the echo of their signature sounds to identify and target potential prey. This is possible because the sounds waves from the bat bounce off the prey and are sent back to the bat; it then uses the specialized cells in its ear to detect the locale of the prey (Harris, 2001).

Chemicals within DDT were responsible for the terminal thinning of eggshells in birds exposed to the pesticide. After DDT went into heavy use, this DDT-resistant gene spread quickly through the mosquito populations because mosquitoes with the resistant gene survived when other mosquitoes were killed. A few mosquitoes had a genetic mutation that protected them from DDT. Alleles for DDT resistance arose by mutation during the period of DDT use because of selection for pesticide resistance. The DDT caused new mutations to occur in the surviving flies and this resulted in resistance to DDT. those that survived possessed a DDT resistant gene.

The cooler temperatures high in the atmosphere cause the vapor to condense into tiny droplets of water, forming clouds.

Structure and Function: Roots anchor the plant in the ground and absorb water and mineral nutrients from the ground. Plants absorb minerals and water through their root hair cells. Minerals dissolve in water in the soil and are absorbed by the roots along with the water, making the minerals available to the plant. As the roots of a young plant spread, they absorb the water and minerals that the plant needs to grow.", "id": "MCAS_2001_5_7", "answerKey": "B"}

Nitrates and phosphates cause algal blooms in surface water, which causes the oxygen level of the water to decline. The most suitable fish to rear in a waste-fed pond are those that are tolerant to low levels of dissolved oxygen, which may be caused by unpredictable algal blooms.

This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it is more likely to be found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. This biome is mostly characterized by\u00a0coniferous\u00a0forests consisting of many plants found below. The pioneer colonisers are deciduous plants that are replaced gradually by semi-deciduous vegetation that persists for very short period of time after which semi-evergreen plants make their appearance.", "id": "Mercury_184800", "answerKey": "B"}

The life cycle of amphibians consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage and metamorphosis to an adult stage.
